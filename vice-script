POV A HARSH POLICE FLASH LIGHT HITS THE DRIVER SIDE WINDOW AS,DICK LEANS HIS HEAD OUT.
DICK,How you doing tonight?
OFFICER,I need you to get out of the car.
SUDDENLY A SECOND PLANE SOARS INTO FRAME AND HITS THE OTHER,TOWER. Everyone gasps.
SECRET SERVICE AGENT,MOVE!!!!!
SECRET SERVICE AGENT #2,A plane just struck the Pentagon.
DICK,Let’s make sure the phone lines are  working. SIVITS.
CONDI RICE,"Phones are a go, Sir."
DICK,Let’s contact the FAA. Find out how  many planes are in the air.
CONDI RICE,"May I get the President on the  line, please?"
STAFFER,That’s right. We’ve got planes in  the air and no where for them to  land.
CONDI RICE,"Mr. Vice President, POTUS on line  1."
DICK,"Mr. President, this situation is  extremely fluid. I am strongly  recommending you stay in the air.  I’ve sequestered Congressional  leadership and I’m coordinating our  response with the White House  team... Okay then..."
STAFFER,"Sir, Don Rumsfeld on 3."
CHENEY,That?
RUMSFELD (V.O.),"Dick, there are still passenger  planes in the air. I need rules of  engagement."
CONDI RICE,Let’s get the President back on the-
DICK,You have authorization to shoot  down any aircraft deemed a threat.
RUMSFELD,Presidential authority?
DICK,That’s correct. All orders are  UNODIR.
CONDI RICE,UNODIR?
KAREN HUGHES,Unless otherwise directed.
NARRATOR (V.O.),"By all accounts of what people saw  in that room on that terrible day,  there was confusion, fear,  uncertainty, but Dick Cheney saw  something else that no one else  did... he saw an opportunity."
NARRATOR (V.O.),"As the world becomes more and more  confusing, we tend to focus on the  things that are right there in  front of us. While ignoring the  massive forces that actually change  and shape our lives."
NARRATOR (V.O.),"And with people working longer and  longer hours, for less and less  wages, when we do have free time,  the last thing we want is  complicated analysis of our  government, lobbying, international  trade agreements."
NARRATOR (V.O.),So it's no surprise that when a  monotone bureaucratic Vice  President came to power. We hardly  noticed. As he achieved a position  of authority that very few leaders  in the history of our nation ever  have.
NARRATOR (V.O.),Forever changing the course of  history for millions and millions  of lives. And he did it like a  ghost. With most people having no  idea who he is or where he came  from.
NARRATOR,How does a man go on to become who  he is? Well it starts in 1963.
NARRATOR,"When Dick's best girl Lynne was  getting straight A's at Colorado College,"
NARRATOR,"Lynne had helped Dick get a  scholarship at Yale, where he did  way more drinking than class  attending. Pretty soon Dick got the  boot. So he went back home to  Wyoming to work as a lineman for  the state."
NARRATOR,Back then they would have been  called a guy like him a ne’er-do- well. In today’s parlance they  would just call him a dirt bag.
LINEMAN #1,Man down !
LINEMAN #2,His leg looks like an Elvis dance  move.
LINEMAN #1,Somebody give that poor son of a  bitch a shot of whiskey.
LINEMAN BOSS,"Alright, back to work. I SAID, Back  to work!"
LINEMAN BOSS (CONT’D),"Take him into town, put $5 in his  pocket. Find another man for  tomorrow."
DICK,You got a problem Cheney?
SHIFTY CREW MEMBER,No sir.
DICK,Are we becoming friends?
SHIFTY CREW MEMBER,Will you stop touching me?
SHIFTY CREW MEMBER (CONT’D),"What you gonna do about it, Mr.  Yale? Huh?"
"DICK, WITH A BLACK EYE AND STAINS ON HIS SHIRT SITS ON THE","Woah! The fuck you gonna do about  it, Mr. Yale? Come on!"
LYNNE,COUCH.
DICK,Two times! Two times I had to drag  you out of that jail like a filthy  hobo!!
LYNNE,"I’m sorry, Lynne..."
DICK,What? What did you just say?
LYNNE,"I’m sorry, Lynney."
DICK,You’re sorry? Don’t call me  “Lynney!”  One time is “I’m sorry.”  Two times makes me think I’ve  picked the wrong man! They kicked  your ass out of Yale for drinking  and fighting! Now are you just a  lush who’s going to hang power  lines for the state? Are we going  to live in a trailer and have ten  children!? Is that the plan?!
LYNNE,Can we please... discuss this  later?
EDNA,No. We discuss it right now while  you smell of piss and cheap booze!
LYNNE,Does Dick want some coffee?
DICK,Mother get out ! Does Dick want some  coffee? Jesus Christ!
LYNNE,Here’s my plan. Either you stand up  and put your back straight and have  the courage to become someone or I  am gone! There are a dozen men and  a few Professors at school who  would date me!
LYNNE (CONT'D),"I love you, Lynne. I’ve loved you  since the day I first saw you."
LYNNE (CONT’D),Then prove it! I can’t go to a big  Ivy League school! I can’t run a  company or be Mayor! That’s just  the way the world is for a girl! I  need you! And right now you’re a  big fat piss soaked zero!
DICK,I’ve seen my Mother waiting up all  night for my Father to come home.
MONOTONE CONGRESSMAN,"And I’ve seen him drunk in this  house raising his voice and way  worse, and I’m not dancing that  dance anymore... I’m not!"
MONOTONE CONGRESSMAN (CONT’D),Can you change? Or am I wasting my  goddamn time?
DONALD RUMSFELD,I won’t ever disappoint you again  Lynne.
DONALD RUMSFELD (CONT’D),You are America’s best and  brightest. God bless you all... and  God bless... this great nation.
NARRATOR (V.O.),Next up is a young man from  Illinois who’s done quite well for  himself here at the Capitol...  Representative Donald Rumsfeld...
NARRATOR (V.O.),So did Bob tell you this internship  is a great honor? Huh? Did he?
NARRATOR (V.O.),"Well, it’s not. It’s what we called  in the Navy “a shit detail.”"
NARRATOR (V.O.),"Donald Rumsfeld, or Rummy as they  called him, was the former captain  of the Princeton wrestling team..."
DONALD RUMSFELD,...and an elite navy jet pilot.
DONALD RUMSFELD (CONT’D),"Most Congressmen used their power  like an axe, Rumsfeld used his like  a master of the Butterfly knives."
STUDENT,"And like any master if you got in  his way, he would cut you."
DICK,"Look, this is an opportunity An  opportunity to work in the halls of  decision making for the most  powerful country in the goddamn  world. If that doesn’t give you a  hard on I don’t know what will.  Sorry to the few ladies in the  room. They used to not have girls  for this program... but now they  do. Anyway, I’m Don. Whatever you  do, don’t work for Bob over here.  He’s the most boring son of a bitch  in DC."
STUDENT,"That’s it. Now scat! Go get a  Congressman a cup of coffee! And if  his wife calls, he’s always in a  meeting!"
DICK,"Hey, I’m Alan. You’re the other guy  from Wisconsin right?"
STUDENT,That’s right...
DICK,"One of us is supposed to start with  a Democrat, the other with a  Republican. Do you care if I go  with the Dem? I did a lot of work  with the DNC on campus."
RUMSFELD,What party was that guy we just  heard?
DICK,Rumsfeld is... a Republican.
RUMSFELD,Perfect. Because that’s what I am.
RUMSFELD (CONT’D),Don’t lurk! Come in dammit!
RUMSFELD (CONT’D),"It’s, uh Dick Cheney... Reporting  for work..."
DICK,You’re Congressional relations for  my Office of Economic Opportunity.  And you’ll assist me in my job as  councillor to the President.
RUMSFELD,You want me to pin your mittens to  your sleeves so you don’t fucking  lose em? Go !
DICK,"By the way Cheney, your two DUIs  showed up on your background check.  Don’t worry. I vouched for you."
RUMSFELD,Thank you sir.
MEDIA CONSULTANT,Thanks are for when neighbor Dottie  pulls your pud for the first time.  You owe me.
NARRATOR (V.O.),"Yes, sir."
DICK CHENEY,GO!
RUMSFELD,You’re Rumsfeld’s lackey right?  Make sure he sees this.
LYNNE,"Roger Ailes, founder of FOX News.  He first pitched the idea as  conservative news when he worked  for Nixon as a media advisor."
RUMSFELD,Roger wants Nixon to start a  Republican TV news network.
RUMSFELD,Forget it. Roger knows TV. But he  doesn’t know politics.
DICK,So I would do this flaming baton  trick and Dick would wait around  with a bucket of water. So I’m at  the State Finals and I throw up the  baton....and it doesn’t come down.
RUMSFELD,Where have you been hiding her  Cheney!?
NARRATOR (V.O.),You’re quiet. I like that. You’re  not blabbing to everyone what cards  you have. I missed my flush draw a  month ago but everyone still thinks  I have pocket kings. Except maybe  fucking Haldeman.
RUMSFELD,I mostly play hearts so I’m not-
DICK,"No, no, no."
RUMSFELD,"For a man like Donald Rumsfeld he  only wanted three things from his  lackey: he had to keep his mouth  shut, do what he was told and  always be loyal."
DICK,So is it a yes or a no?
RUMSFELD,It’s a yes.
NARRATOR (V.O.),You don’t even know what the  question is do you?
STAFFER,"I, uh, I assume it was-"
NARRATOR (V.O.),Good. That’s exactly the kind of  “yes” I was looking for.
NARRATOR (V.O.),"Cheney had always been a so so  student and a mediocre athlete. But  now finally he had found his life's  calling, he would be a dedicated  and humble servant to power."
DICK,Here’s your new office. No windows.  But all you’d see is a bunch of  hippies flipping off Nixon.
LYNNE,Now at this point you're probably  wondering who exactly I am.
DICK,"Well my name is Kurt. My favorite  football team is the Steelers. And  me and my son love watching Sponge  Bob. And if you are wondering how I  know so much about Dick Cheney,  well let's just say we are kind of  related... We’ll get to that later."
LYNNE,Lynnie... guess where I’m calling  from?
DICK,I am so damn proud of you right now  Dick Cheney... I knew I picked the  right man. I knew it even when I  didn’t...
DICK (CONT’D),We did it.
LYNNE,Have you seen Nixon?
DICK,I did. I met him. Shook his hand.  That impish smile of his.
LYNNE,"Pardon my French, but it’s the best  fucking feeling in the world."
YOUNG LIZ,I am so proud of you.
DICK,I love you.
RUMSFELD,WE are proud of you. Your girls are  proud of you.
RUMSFELD (CONT’D),Are you proud of your Daddy?
DICK,Yes!
RUMSFELD,"Now that I’m not just flipping  cards, I have a few ideas--"
DICK,Stop.
RUMSFELD,You see that door?
DICK,Isn’t that Kissinger’s office?
RUMSFELD,"Yes, but I happen to know that  Nixon’s in there right now. Now why  would Nixon not meet Kissinger in  the Oval Office?"
DICK,He’s having a conversation he  doesn’t want to go on the record?
RUMSFELD,Very good.
DICK,What’s the conversation?
RUMSFELD,They’re going to bomb Cambodia.
RUMSFELD (V.O.),That’s impossible. That would have  to be approved by Congress and I’m  over there every day-
RUMSFELD (V.O.),"Fuck Congress. Unless you’re in it.  Then it’s the greatest deliberative  body on earth. But we’re not, so  fuck it."
RUMSFELD,I thought the President campaigned  on ending the war?
MASSIVE EXPLOSION. WE SEE BLOOD AND LIMBS AND HEAR SCREAMS,Shhhh. Listen to me...
DICK,"Because of the conversation Nixon  and Kissinger are having right  behind this door, five feet away  from us... in a few days, 10  thousand miles away..."
RUMSFELD,... a rain of 750 pound bombs  dropped from B-52s flying at twenty  thousand feet will hit villages and  towns across Cambodia...thousands  will die and the world will change  either for the worse or the better.
DICK,"That’s the kind of power that  exists in this squat little ugly  building. But screw Kissinger, he’s  over rated. Come on!"
RUMSFELD,"JUST FOR A SPLIT SECOND, THEN CUT BACK to Cheney still  looking at the office door."
DICK,"So, uh, what do we... I mean are we  against spending, or are we, uh..."
8YR OLD LIZ,Come on... Out with it!
DICK,"What do we, uh, believe?"
NARRATOR (V.O.),“What do we believe?” Good one  Cheney! Good one!
RUMSFELD,"We find out what the fish wants,  and in this case it’s a worm, and  then we use it to catch them."
DICK,So is it a good trick we’re  playing?
RUMSFELD,It’s not good or bad. It’s fishing.
DICK,"Dick had taken a job as a political  consultant for a large financial  firm, where he was finally making  good money. He took the job because  Nixon’s inner circle had had enough  of Donald Rumsfeld."
LYNNE,I’m out. They’re sending me to  Brussels.
RUMSFELD,"Wait, what?"
DICK,Nixon’s making me permanent  ambassador to NATO. It’s a fuck off  assignment. Kissinger and Haldeman  won. Come with me.
RUMSFELD,I have a four and a seven year old.
NARRATOR (V.O.),Tell Don we’re not moving just  because everyone at the White House  hates him!
LYNNE,Good boy. I taught you well these  past few years.
NARRATOR (V.O.),"I’m sorry, Don. I really am."
NARRATOR,Don’t worry. I’m like bed bugs. You  gotta burn the mattress to get rid  of me!
LYNNE,"Dick was becoming sharper and  sharper as a D.C. insider, and  Lynne had started to write articles  and explore ideas for her first  novel."
NARRATOR,Dick?... Something terrible has  happened...
THE FUNERAL HAS ENDED. WAYNE IS TRYING TO DO A HANDSTAND FOR,"Then, she received news from back  home in Casper."
LYNNE,"Lynne’s mother Edna, who had  avoided the water her whole life,  was found drowned in the local  Caspar Lake. They said her and  Wayne, Lynne’s Dad, had had a nasty  argument an hour before."
DICK,"She doesn’t swim, Dick. My Mother  doesn’t swim. She never swam."
LYNNE,There was never a serious  investigation into Lynne's Mom's  death.
WAYNE,LIZ AND MARY. Lynne stops him.
WAYNE (CONT’D),Dad...Dad...
DICK,"Girls, Lynne. Why don’t you go to  the car."
WAYNE,Come on. Listen to your Father.
DICK,Heya Dick. You catching any fish?
CIA AGENT,How’s it going in DC?
SCOOTER LIBBY,Don’t ever go near my daughters or  my wife again.
CIA AGENT,Big shot! Big shot in D.C. Dick!
DICK,So what do you got?
DICK (CONT’D),"Hassan Mustafa Nasr. A cleric based  in Milan, Italy. He’s a member of  Al-Gama’s al-Islamiyya, the group  that killed Anwar Sadat."
CLERIC,"That’s the blind sheik, right?"
DICK,There’s some debate at Langley on  whether they’re a threat or not.  They claim to be peaceful now.
CIA AGENT,I “claim” to be eating healthy.
RICHARD NIXON (V.O.),Okay... pick him up.
RICHARD NIXON (SOT),NOO! Help! Help me!
DICK,What’s the next name?
LIZ,"Well Mr. Vice President, there’s  been some chatter about an  engineering student in Berlin..."
LYNNE,I have never been a quitter.
LIZ,But I must put the interests of the  nation first...
DICK,Nixon forgot the voice activated  recorders were there. He got  sloppy.
LYNNE,"Mom, is the President being  punished?"
DICK,The President has a lot of enemies.  Never forget Lizzy: when you get  power they always try and take it  from you. Always.
RUMSFELD,Yes M’am.
DICK,Donald Rumsfeld please...
RUMSFELD,"I can’t believe this, this is our  President. This is a tragedy!"
CHENEY,"I actually think this could be  very, very good news."
RICHARD NIXON (SOT),What’s your read on things?
RUMSFELD,"The way I see it, any Republican  not touched by Watergate is golden  right now."
DICK,Nice. Ford called me right before  my flight took off.
RUMSFELD,"You’re still driving this chick  magnet, huh?"
DICK,You can always take the bus.
RUMSFELD,Effective immediately I will resign  the Presidency of the United States  and Vice President Ford will be  sworn in tomorrow at noon.
RUMSFELD (CONT’D),So what’s the plan?
DICK,The plan? Well the plan is to take  over the damn place...
RUMSFELD,Who lit a fire under your ass?
DICK,I haven’t flipped cards in a long  time Don.
RUMSFELD,They gave me the damn keys to the  palace!
CHENEY,Chief of Staff
KISSINGER,Holy shit. You salty son of a  bitch. You did it.
FORD,Now we have work to do. Kissinger  is trying to kiss and make up with  the Soviets.
NARRATOR (V.O.),"Well, let’s make sure that shit  doesn’t happen."
DICK,Yeah. Yeah.
KISSINGER,"If I may, I believe I may have a  way to put an ore in the water, on  Russia. What if-"
FORD,Mr. President-
"MORE MEMOS THROWN IN THE GARBAGE, PHONES HUNG UP, NAMES",Come on Henry let’s hear Dick out.
RADIO NEWS MONTAGE (V.O.),"One of Dick Cheney’s super powers,  was the ability to make the most  wild and extreme ideas sound  measured and professional."
LYNNE,"What if on a unilateral basis, we  all put miniature wigs on our  penises, and we walked out to the  White House lawn, and we jerked  each other off. So, like a puppet  show, but much more enjoyable?"
DICK,I do like a good puppet show.
LYNNE,I say we do it!
SECRET SERVICE AGENT,"CROSSED OFF MEETING LISTS, LINES ON MEMOS REWRITTEN."
DICK,They’re calling it the Halloween  Massacre. Donald Rumsfeld has  replaced Secretary of Defense James  Slessinger. And Dick Cheney has  been chosen as the--
LYNNE,--the youngest Chief of Staff in  history! It’s like a dream.
MARY,It’s real. And Don is the youngest  Secretary of Defense ever.
DICK,"Well, I’m not talking about Don,  I’m talking about you. And I’m  going to give you a kiss, right her  in the White House."
MARY,Excuse me Mr. and Mrs. Cheney.  These girls tried to enter the Oval  Office.
DICK,Oh dear!
LYNNE,"Girls this is not a playground,  please do not--"
LYNNE (CONT'D),Daddy! Is this where Santa lives?
DICK,Better than Santa. It’s where the  leader of the greatest nation on  earth lives!
NARRATOR (V.O.),Are you one of his elves Daddy?
DICK,"In a way, yes."
NARRATOR (V.O.),No he’s not Mary. Your Father is  Chief of Staff. Chief. Of Staff.
YOUNG LAWYER,"Dick, if you’re silly with her  she’ll grow up to be a silly woman."
DICK,"Right of course, I forgot, that’s  just silly, Mary."
YOUNG LAWYER,"And as the new Chief of Staff and  with the Presidency weakened by  Watergate, Dick Cheney wanted to  find out exactly how much power did  the President have."
NARRATOR,I would like to reinstate Executive  Authority. How?
WIFE,"Antonin Scalia, a young lawyer with  the justice department who would  later go on to serve on the Supreme  Court, rocked Dick’s world."
"IMAGES OF THE WHITE HOUSE, THE SCALES OF JUSTICE AND SOLDIERS",Have you heard of the theory of the  unitary executive?
NARRATOR (V.O.),"No, tell me about it."
NARRATOR,"It’s an interpretation a few, like  myself happen to believe, of  Article two of the Constitution  that vests the President with  absolute executive authority. And I  mean absolute."
NARRATOR (CONT’D),"Honey, you wanna get Cole up to the  high chair? I gotta explain this to  the people."
BARBARA WALTERS (SOT),Come on buddy!
NARRATOR (V.O.),AT WAR.
LYNNE,"The Unitary Executive Theory  Certain legal scholars believe that  if the President does anything it  must be legal because it’s the  President. To hell with checks and  balances, especially during times  of war. This was the power of  kings, pharaohs, dictators,"
RUMSFELD,"Dick Cheney was a foot soldier in  the power games of Washington DC,  but with the Unitary Executive  Theory, he could become Galactus,  devourer of planets,"
FORD,But then it was Election Day and  there was one big problem...
TV REPORTER (V.O.),...Which means that Jimmy Carter is  the next President of the United  States.
DAVID BRINKLEY (SOT),And just like that it was all over.
PRESIDENT CARTER (SOT),That can’t be right. It got to be  some sort of a mistake.
DICK,Well...there goes the neighborhood.
LYNNE,Thank you everybody.
DICK,"The Republicans have lost the  Presidency, they are the minority  in Congress and in most states.  With America demanding change, I  don’t see a future for the GOP.  They are the party of the past."
CAMPAIGN MANAGER,President Carter went to the roof  of the White House today to  announce his new solar  initiative...
DICK,"We must end our dependence on  fossil fuels. And by the using the  energy God gave us in the sun, we  may have an endless source of power  with solar energy..."
LYNNE,"...I will become the gentleman from  Wyoming. And hear this, taxes must  come down."
DICK,Talk. Talk.
FADE UP ON AN ACTUAL HEART BEATING AND THEN STOPPING AND THEN,"I’ll say it again, taxes must go  down, we must ameliorate pain for  the taxes of the working man....and  bring perspicacity to the fore."
DOCTOR,Thank God for name recognition.
LYNNE,"But enough of the horsing around.  Which is of course, what us cowboys  do. So uh, remember, vote Cheney  for Congress. Uhh, thank you and  vote for Cheney in Congress."
DOCTOR,"Either he drinks next time, or I  do."
DICK,I don’t want anyone to panic. But I  do believe I have to go to the  hospital.
LYNNE,BEATING ERRATICALLY BEFORE FINALLY IT STOPS
MAYOR,It’s an inferior wall infarct.
LYNNE,"But it can be fixed, right?"
CAMPAIGN MANAGER,If it was up to me you’d drop out  of the election. But you’ve both  made it clear that’s not an option.  So you must have a minimum of two  weeks bed rest.
LYNNE,Two weeks off. We’ll lose our lead.
LYNNE (V.O.),The hell we will.
LYNNE,Dick Cheney has an illness so he  can’t be here today. But we have  his wife and a heck of a pretty gal  here to fill in: Lynne Cheney!
NARRATOR (V.O.),I grew up in Wyoming. But somewhere  along the line Washington DC  stopped listening to real folks  like us! And started only listening  to liberal snobs who want us all to  lose our jobs to affirmative  action!
DICK,Okay Lynne...
NARRATOR (V.O.),When I was in New York City I saw  women burning their bras. Well you  know what women do with bras in  Wyoming? We wear them !
NARRATOR (V.O.),Here in Wyoming we believe there is  a right and a wrong.
NARRATOR (V.O.),"Because I’m a mom and a wife from  Wyoming. And I know how it feels to  make every penny count. And not  only do I speak for you, my husband  Dick Cheney..."
REAGAN,"A hard wind of change had been  blowing through America, civil  rights, Roe versus Wade,  environmentalism. But there was a  part of the country that didn’t  like this change and wanted it to  stop."
NARRATOR,"Thanks to my amazing wife, it is  good to be joining you all here in  D.C. as Wyoming’s sole  Congressional Representative!"
CLERK,"And then big money families like  the Kochs and the Coors that were  sick of paying income taxes, rolled  into Washington DC and started  writing fat checks to fund right  wing think tanks..."
PANICKED AIDE,...that would change the way many  Americans looked at the world.
DICK,"Finally in 1980, this unlikely  revolution of the super rich and  white conservatives found its  face..."
LYNNE,"For those who have abandoned hope,  we'll restore hope, and we'll  welcome them into a great national  crusade... to make America great  again!"
LYNNE (CONT’D),"It was the fucking 1980’s, and it  was a hell of a time to be Dick  Cheney."
GEORGE BUSH SR,Vote on the Undetectable fire arms  Act to ban “plastic guns that can  evade metal detectors”... Clean  water act... endangered species  act... School lunch  program...Martin Luther King Jr  federal holiday...
LYNNE,Someone call an ambulance !!
GEORGE BUSH SR,Can you breathe?
LYNNE,I’m having a heart attack you  idiot.
GEORGE BUSH SR,Thank you... I’m very excited.
DICK,"They’re both brilliant, but broke."
NARRATOR (V.O.),Hey Dick... Hello Lynne.  Congratulations on your  appointment.
"QUICK CLIPS OF MORTON DOWNEY JR, RUSH LIMBAUGH, AND THEN A",Why thank you Mr. Vice President.  How is your lovely family?
NEWS ANCHOR,My son Jeb seems cut out for  office. We may be asking you for  endorsements in a few years.
LANKY DRUNK GUY,"If he’s half as charming as you  George, he’s got both our votes."
DICK,Dick. I just wanted to say thank  you for getting the House not to  override the President’s veto of  the fairness doctrine.
GEORGE BUSH SR,Not a problem. Happy to get rid of  any big government regulations.
LYNNE,The fairness doctrine was a law  from the forties that required any  broadcast TV or radio news to  present both sides of an issue  equally. Its repeal would lead to  the rise of opinion news.
DICK,GIANT FOX NEWS ANIMATED LOGO “FAIR AND BALANCED.”
LYNNE,... And eventually to the  realization of Roger Ailes’ dream:  Fox News. Which would go on to  dominate all other news and swing  America even more to the right.
DICK,Lighten up sweetie! It’s a party!
TEACHER,What’s that fella’s problem?
MARY CHENEY,Let me go see if everything’s okay  over there. Great to see you both.  Love to the girls...
LYNNE,That’s his son. George W. He’s the  black sheep of the family.
MARY,A little too much unconditional  love.
LYNNE,"Can you feel it Dick? Half the room  wants to be us and the other half  fears us. I know George is up next  but after that, who knows?"
MARY,I respect the hell out of Reagan...  But no one’s really shown the world  the true power of the American  Presidency...
MARY (CONT’D),Excuse me Ms. Cheney! You cannot  leave the grounds during school  hours! Mary! Come back!
DICK,"No, no, no!!!"
MARY,I just don’t understand. You left  school? Why? It doesn’t make sense.
LYNNE,It was Susan...
NARRATOR,Your best friend? Were you fighting  over a boy?
NARRATOR (CONT’D),She broke up with me...
DICK,"Mom, Dad, I like girls... I’m gay."
LYNNE,It doesn’t matter sweetheart. We  will always love you no matter  what.
DICK,"Oh, I love you so much Daddy..."
LYNNE,It’s just going to be... so hard  for you...
DICK CHENEY,"When George Bush Sr. was elected  President, Dick Cheney was made  Secretary of Defense. Sixth in line  to the Presidency."
LYNNE (O.C.),"And after a few years, it was  Dick’s turn to run for President,  so they decided to do some early  polling numbers."
DICK CHENEY,Well I guess that’s it.
DICK,"We can move those numbers. We  attack the welfare state,  regulations, government waste..."
DICK (CONT'D),It’ll be a war. I can’t put Mary  through that. Every primary  opponent will go after her...
LYNNE,We deny. Shame them for going after  the family...
DICK,"Okay, okay. I’m coming..."
LYNNE,Who’s calling on a Sunday morning?!
DICK CHENEY,I don’t know!
LYNNE,Hello. Cheney residence?... Uh- huh...I understand... Anyway I can  be of assistance... Okay...
LYNNE (CONT’D),That should work... 3pm... Of  course... That goes without  saying...
DICK,Who was it?!
LYNNE,It was someone from George Bush’s  son’s campaign.
DICK,Jeb?
LYNNE,No. George W... Jeb’s Florida.
DICK,Right. I still can’t believe  they’ve got that poor boy running  for President.
LYNNE,So what did they want?
DICK,They want to talk to me about being  his running mate.
LYNNE,What?
DICK,They didn’t say it outright but  I’ve made that call myself and  that’s what they want.
LYNNE,Vice President is a nothing job.
THERESA,I’m just going to hear them out. I  owe his Father that...
DICK,VP just waits for the President to  die. You’ve said it yourself.
W BUSH,It’s just a meeting.
DICK,Is it just a meeting? Or is it just  a meeting?
W BUSH,It’s just a meeting.
DICK,Good.
W BUSH,The Governor will see you now  Secretary Cheney.
DICK,Sure.
W BUSH,Hello Dick.
DICK,Hello George.
W BUSH,It’s been awhile.
DICK,Since last year. The foreign policy  sessions...
W BUSH,That’s right. Those meetings were  very engaging. I remember we both  agreed my Dad would have been re- elected if he had taken out Saddam.
DICK,War time Presidents are always  popular.
W BUSH,That they are. That they are.
DICK,So... Congratulations on a  successful primary. I’ve been  through a few myself and they can  be... Shall we say-
W BUSH,Fucking exhausting?
DICK (V.O.),Yes.
W BUSH,"Buses, bologna sandwiches. I mean I  like people but enough’s enough. Am  I right?"
THERESA,"So uh, the call I received..."
W BUSH,"I forgot, you’re a brass tacks guy  aren’t you? I like that. Are you  surprised I’m running for  President? After my, shall we say,  wild years?"
DICK,I sowed some oats myself back in  the day. Still enjoy a cold beer on  occasion.
W BUSH,I bet you did. I bet you did you  rascal. Well I can’t anymore. It  got bad... Real bad.
DICK,What does he really want? What does  he need?
W BUSH,Do you want some brisket? Theresa  can we get some brisket?!
DICK,Yes sir!
W BUSH,Get the burnt ends!
DICK,George... Listen...
W BUSH,"So listen, I’ve got a lack of  experience problem in the polls and  you’re one of the most experienced  guys around. You wanna jump on  board and be my Vice?"
DICK,...I’m honored.
W BUSH,Don’t be honored. Fucking say yes  Mr. Brass tacks.
DICK,...I have to say no at this time.
W BUSH,Come on. I know you love politics.  What are you in the private sector  now? Come on...
DICK,I can’t.
W BUSH,That’s a shame. It is. I really  need you near my campaign.
LYNNE,"Perhaps... I, uh, could help you  find the right running mate?"
DICK,You mean run my VP search team?
LYNNE,No team. Me.
DICK,"Yeah, yeah. That could work. I’ll  have to run it by Rove of course."
LYNNE,"This campaign’s gonna be a bitch.  But if I lose I can maybe become  commissioner of baseball, you know?"
NARRATOR (V.O.),"But the idea is to win, right?"
DICK,I’m going to keep you in the back  of my mind.
NARRATOR (V.O.),So are you going to tell me how it  went today or not?
LYNNE,It was... interesting. He is  a...green. He’s very green.
NARRATOR (V.O.),And you told him no?
NARRATOR (V.O.),I told him I’d help with the  search.
NARRATOR,What are you thinking? I can tell  you’re thinking.
NARRATOR (CONT’D),What was Dick Cheney thinking?
NARRATOR (CONT’D),I’m thinking I’ve never seen  anything like this.
NARRATOR (V.O.),After his first meeting with George  W.
NARRATOR,We’ve had a lot of successes Dick.  Vice President is a nothing job.
LYNNE,How many steps ahead was he  looking? How did he feel about the  opportunity that was in front of  him?
DICK,"There are certain moments, that are  so delicate. Like a teacup and  saucer..."
LYNNE,Stacked on a teacup and saucer...
LYNNE (CONT'D),Stacked on a teacup and saucer....
LYNNE (CONT’D),And on and on. That this moment  could fall in any direction and  change everything.
DICK,Sadly there is no real way to know  exactly what was going on with the  Cheneys at this history changing  moment. We can’t just snap into a  Shakespearian Soliloquy that  dramatizes every feeling and  emotion. That’s just not the way  the world works.
LYNNE,You know what?
DICK,"My sweet Richard. Dance’d nimbly round the King’s  hearth thou hath.  Even whilst clamored I for more,  more! Parched maw craned towards the  drip, drip of imagined waters. But I say to you now, rest, retire.  Thou hast honored thy vows to wife  and crown."
LYNNE,Has blindness usurped vision in you  my wife? No mere treaty is our union! Thou shared thy torch’s flame with  mine. Revealing halls and spires of long  faded empires.  But now I hold aloft mine own fiery  cresset To make flesh our bond of power.
DICK,"Dare I? Dare I let hope’s beak place  gathered bramble Upon my heart for future’s nest? Many winters past hath I let this  hope die,  cruel winds silencing tiny birds  needy cries"
DICK,"Now that it hath arrived I say yea,  yea!  Mine own blood and will, are yours  til pierced be the last soldier’s  breast plate,  spilling open its jellied ruby  treasures!"
DAVID GRIBBIN,So?
LIZ,So...I think we proceed.
LYNNE,What about Mary?
LIZ,It’s VP. It’s not the same  scrutiny.
DICK,He’s got allies Dick...  Connections. You’re new to his  world. You don’t know the  landscape.
DAVID ADDINGTON,"Well, then I had better run a very  thorough search..."
NARRATOR (V.O.),"Every stone. Hell, every grain of  sand needs to be looked under for  this questionnaire."
DAVID ADDINGTON,"Dick we’re asking for all  financials, all medical, all  interviews, press, writings, legal  records, family medical and family  financials. Any more  “comprehensive” and we’d need a  rubber glove. Sorry Liz."
DICK,That wasn’t offensive. Should I be  offended?
DAVID ADDINGTON,I’m offended Dave wasn’t worried  I’d be offended.
DICK,"Oh, a rubber glove. Like a  proctology exam. That’s...that’s  disgusting."
DAVID ADDINGTON,Hey David. Any thoughts?
DICK,One big one.
DAVID ADDINGTON,"David Addington, Dicks main legal  advisor and a huge believer in the  Unitary Executive Theory. He was  known for telling people to their  face that they were stupid."
W BUSH,"So the Vice Presidency is part of  the executive branch and because  the VP casts tie breaking votes in  the Senate, also part of the  legislative branch, right?"
DICK,Okay?
W BUSH,That means the VP is also not part  of the executive or the  legislative.
DICK,So one could argue neither branch  has oversight of the VP?
W BUSH,"Not only can “one” argue that, I’m  arguing it right now."
DICK,Brilliant David.
W BUSH,I know! Right?
DICK,Rove made me buy this ranch. He  wanted to distance me from my years  at Yale and Harvard. Make me more  of a man of the people for the  election.
W BUSH,Smart.
DICK,"So, we gonna do this thing or what?  Is this happening?"
W BUSH,We’ve found some very interesting  candidates. I think if we could  schedule a three hour window to go  through each one-
DICK,No. I meant are you going to be my  VP? I want you
W BUSH,"I’m CEO of a large company. I’ve  been Secretary of Defense, Chief of  Staff... The Vice Presidency is a  mostly symbolic job..."
W BUSH (CONT’D),"Right, right. I can see how that  wouldn’t be enticing to you."
DICK,However... the Vice Presidency is  also defined by the President. If  we were to have a... different  understanding...
W BUSH,Uh-huh. Go on.
DICK,"I get the sense you’re a, shall we  say, kinetic leader. You make  decisions based on instinct. You’re  very different from your father in  that regard."
W BUSH,I am. People have always said that.
DICK,"Maybe I could handle the more  mundane parts of the job. Managing  the bureaucracy, overseeing the  military, energy, foreign policy..."
W BUSH,That sounds good.
W BUSH  (O.S.),I never want to be the kind of team  owner that pulls the starter in the  4th inning. That’s the manager’s  job.
NARRATOR (V.O.),And one last thing. My daughter  Mary...
SCOOTER LIBBY,Right... Rove told me she likes  girls.
DICK,I know you’ll have to run against  gay marriage for the south and the  mid-west. But it’s my daughter and  that line in drawn in concrete.
SCOOTER LIBBY,"So long as you don’t mind us  pushing that messaging. Sure, we’re  okay with you sitting that one out.  I think it’s important for all the  Marys in the world, you know? No  problemo."
DICK,Then I believe this can work.
SCOOTER LIBBY,"Hot Damn! Well good, let’s  celebrate!"
DICK,"When I was searching for a Vice  President I turned to the  experience of Dick Cheney. But I soon realized he was the best  choice. Please welcome, my friend  and my running mate: Dick Cheney!  And his lovely wife Lynne!"
SCOOTER LIBBY,"Dick never filled out his own 83  question questionnaire. Full  medical records were never handed  over. No tax or corporate filings,  nothing."
DICK,Gore rescinded his concession.  They’re claiming Florida is too  close to call.
NEWSCASTER (V.O.),He can’t fucking rescind his  concession.
DICK,He just did. There’s going to be a  recount. What should we do?
ADDINGTON,We play it like we’ve already won. Which means we need to staff the  White House.
DICK,Who’s leading the transition team?
ADDINGTON,I’ll do it.
LIZ,"Um, that’s not really something a  Vice President does, is it?"
MARY,It is now.
DICK,Gore has called Governor Bush and  retracted his concession.
ADDINGTON,Wolfowitz. State or Pentagon?
LYNNE,Depends on who your Secretary of  Defense is.
DICK,Rummy.
LYNNE,100%
DICK,Rumsfeld?
LYNNE,Doesn’t Bush Sr. hate Rummy?
MARSHALL,That’s not a bad thing with W. He  wants to be his own man.
NARRATOR (V.O.),Rumsfeld believes in a robust  Executive. That’s good for us on  war powers.
NARRATOR (V.O.),"Just keep him out of state, he’ll  start World War three."
OVERHEAD SHOT OF A PROCESSION OF 5 BLACK LIMOS DRIVING INTO,Halliburton gave us a 26 million  dollar exit package. Twice as much  as we were hoping for.
YOUNG DICK,They’re no dummies.
YOUNG LYNNE,Uh. Sorry gang. But I think  perhaps... I should go to the  hospital...
YOUNG DICK,Oh no. Are you kidding me?
YOUNG LYNNE,"Oyez! Oyez! Oyez! All persons  having business before the  Honorable, the Supreme Court of the  United States, are admonished to  draw near and give their attention,  for the Court is now sitting. God  bless the United States and this  Honorable Court."
YOUNG LYNNE (CONT’D),"December 12th 2000. Antonin Scalia,  remember him? And the Supreme Court  stopped the state of Florida from  completing their recount."
YOUNG DICK,George W Bush and Dick Cheney were  going to the Whitehouse by a margin  of 537 votes.
YOUNG LYNNE,THE HEART OF DC
YOUNG DICK,Hey little Mary. My little Mary.  How are you doing?
DICK,"They’re both doing really well.  Except I’m trying to make this  dinner and it’s this, uh, Macaroni  and Cheese that they said was easy,  but it just keeps coming out a  little watery."
SCOOTER LIBBY,"It’s the milk, remember. You gotta  add more milk. Yep, make it  thicker."
A GIANT HAND PUTS A “GEORGE W BUSH GAME PIECE” (LIKE,There’s so much I want to say right  now. You just keep doing what  you’re doing. You’re doing so  great.
SCOOTER LIBBY (V.O.),You have earned something very  special from your wife.
SCOOTER LIBBY (V.O.),Listen! Listen! I’m buying wine and  I’m picking something up. Chinese?
SCOOTER LIBBY (V.O.),I really love you.
SCOOTER LIBBY (V.O.),I love you.
SCOOTER LIBBY (V.O.),"Scooter, why don’t you let everyone  know the lay of the land?"
SCOOTER LIBBY,"Of course. As you all know, I’m  Scooter Libby, Dick’s Chief of  Staff..."
DICK,STRATEGO)
RUMSFELD,DOWN IN THE OVAL OFFICE.
DICK,But I’m also a special adviser to  the President.
RUMSFELD,Mary Matalin will serve as an  adviser to the VP and to Bush.
DICK,"David Addington, Dick’s main legal  counsel, will play center field on  all matters relating to executive  power."
ADDINGTON,"The President has Alberto Gonzales,  Karl Rove and Karen Hughes as his  team."
SCOOTER LIBBY,"Quite frankly Gonzales has no clue,  Rove is a hack and Hughes should be  in double A ball."
DICK,We will be automatically BCC’d on  all emails the President receives  or sends. As well as have access to  his schedule the second it is set  or changed.
PAUL WOLFOWITZ,We’ll also be receiving the daily  intelligence briefing before the  President so we can get inside the  decision curve.
SCOOTER LIBBY,Jesus. Bush approved all of this?
PAUL WOLFOWITZ,We have... an understanding.
DICK,What about the emails? Paper  shredders don’t work with emails.
SCOOTER LIBBY,The entire administration will run  off of the RNC’s private server.
RUMSFELD,And we’ve deactivated automatic  archiving. We’re clean.
DICK,"Okay, so over at the Pentagon we’ve  got Don as Secretary of Defense. Paul Wolfowitz, who worked with  Team B in the Ford days, as  Undersecretary of Defense."
RUMSFELD,"Let’s check what kind of plans they  have to invade Iraq, okay Paul?"
SCOOTER LIBBY,It’s already in the works.
DICK,We’ve got Ashcroft at the DOJ.  State seems to be the only tricky  department. That’s Colin Powell and  his guy Lawrence Wilkerson.
RUMSFELD,We’ve got Bolton over there. He’s a  loose cannon but loyal.
DICK,I want to get Liz in there as well.  Let’s make sure that happens.
RUMSFELD,Consider it done.
DICK,And this list of “our” people  doesn’t include about 800 others  lobbyists and industry insiders we  placed in the regulatory jobs.
NARRATOR (V.O.),"Hey. What did you do with W’s  friends? Pataki, Ridge, Thompson? I  didn’t hear their names."
DENNIS HASTERT,They were not offered jobs in this  administration at this time.
NARRATOR (V.O.),“Were not offered jobs at this  time?” Have you gotten more  ruthless Dick!? You must not be  getting laid!
TRENT LOTT,Moving on!
NARRATOR (V.O.),"Listen Don, you haven’t been here  in over 20 years. Times have  changed. The softer touch is the  norm now. We have the conservative  radio and TV doing the yelling for  us."
DONALD RUMSFELD,Is your old friend embarrassing  you? Is that it Dick?
NARRATOR (V.O.),"Soft touch, that’s all."
GEORGE TENET,Alright. I have to go to my office  over at the House of  Representatives.
NARRATOR (V.O.),You mean the Senate? Vice President  is the tie breaker in the Senate.
"HUNDREDS OF GOP CONGRESSMEN, LOBBYISTS AND MEMBERS OF THE",No. I mean the House.
NARRATOR (V.O.),Dick Cheney had used an old  connection with former wrestling  coach and speaker of the house  Dennis Hastert to get an office at  the House of Representatives. The  house is where revenue bills  originate and he wanted to be near  the money faucet.
NARRATOR,Hey Dick! Will this work for you?
GROVER NORQUIST,"And not one, but two offices at the  Senate..."
FRANK LUNTZ,Hey Dick. I found this extra office  for you.
FRANK LUNTZ,One in the Pentagon...
FRANK LUNTZ (CONT’D),I picked out this one personally.  And I got you a welcoming gift!
FRANK LUNTZ (CONT’D),"And later when Cheney’s team was  combing through the intelligence on  Iraq, a conference room at the CIA."
SNIPPETS OF TALK RADIO (V.O.),The room is soundproof and secure  Mr. Vice President.
NEWSCASTER (SOT),But there was one relatively new  think tank that had become the  place to be in Washington DC.  Americans for Tax Reform.
NARRATOR,RIGHT WING MEDIA are seated and waiting.
NEWSCASTER,"Grover Norquist ran the anti-tax  group with huge funding from the  Koch brothers network, big oil and  tobacco."
DICK CHENEY,His Wednesday meeting as it was  called had become the center of the  Republican world.
SCOOTER LIBBY,Let’s talk about the estate tax.  This has been hard to eliminate  because the tax only applies to  estates larger than 2 million  dollars. But marketing guru Frank  Luntz is here to help...
DICK,Hello all. Getting regular people  to support cutting taxes for the  very wealthy has always been very  difficult. But I think we’ve had a  break through...
DAVID ADDINGTON,The Estate Tax kicks in for anyone  inheriting over $2 Million dollars.  How many of you have a problem with  that?
SCOOTER LIBBY,"Now, how many of you would have a  problem with someone called a  “death tax?”"
DAVID ADDINGTON,"Instead of global warming, which we  all agree sounds very scary, we  call it... climate change?"
DAVID ADDINGTON (CONT’D),"Folks, the government is taking  your money AFTER you die!... It’s a  death tax... Death tax... The  liberals want you to pay a tax when  you die! etc."
DOUG,The liberals would tax you for  laughing or crying if they could.
DAVID ADDINGTON,"So with one of the biggest media  and political machines every  created behind him, Cheney was able  to squash action Global Warming,  cut taxes for the super rich and  gut regulations for massive  corporations."
DICK,And then there was Cheney’s  National Energy Policy Development  Group. His first major test to  expand executive power.
OTHER MAN,I don’t understand what the goddamn  problem is! I want to hear what the  energy CEOs need and I’m not  allowed to?
ADDINGTON,It’s called FACA.
NARRATOR (V.O.),What the hell is FACA?
NARRATOR,"It’s the Federal Advisory  Committees Act. Congress got their  panties in a bunch that elected  officials would just let CEOs roll  in and, you know, write the laws."
NARRATOR (CONT’D),The Act demands that appropriate  government officials be present.
NEWSCASTER (V.O.),Hold on a second.
CNN ANCHOR (SOT),"Hello? What’s your name?... Doug?  Doug, how long have you been  working reception at the Department  of Energy? Three months? Perfect."
SECRET SERVICE AGENT,So what am I supposed to do?
SECRET SERVICE AGENT (CONT’D),Just sit there and be quiet.
THE SECRET SERVICE AGENT GRABS CHENEY BY THE BELT AND LIFTS,Hello
SECRET SERVICE AGENT #2,and
LYNNE,. How’s  business at
STAFFER,?
STAFFER (CONT’D),We’re good.
CHENEY,has been  performing quite well and
DICK,and
RUMSFELD,are quite optimistic.
DICK,"Oh, he’s with the Energy  Department."
CONDI RICE,The details of Cheney's meetings  with the energy CEO's were never  disclosed.
KAREN HUGHES,"But a freedom of information  request did provide some documents,  including a map of Iraq's oil  fields with all of the oil  companies that would be interested  in acquiring them if “somehow” they  were ever to become available."
CONDI RICE,"And then, it happened."
DICK,"This just in, you are looking at a  very disturbing live shot. That is  the World Trade Center and we have  unconfirmed reports that a plane  has crashed into one of the towers."
DAVID ADDINGTON,Oh my God! That was a second plane!  A second plane has hit the south  tower!!
NARRATOR (V.O.),"Mr. Vice President, we have  credible information that a plane  is headed for the White House at  this moment. We have less than a  minute to get to the secure  underground bunker."
KAREN HUGHES,Let’s MOVE !!
DICK,HIM OFF THE GROUND. Everyone rushes to the door and down  stairs. They make their way into a Cold War era bunker. The  Secret Service Agent straggles behind with another AGENT.
KAREN HUGHES,But Mrs. Cheney I’m being told no  one is to go to the White House.  It’s not safe.
DICK,"I said, you take me to the White  House!"
KAREN HUGHES,That’s right. We’ve got planes in  the air and no where for them to  land. Permission for them to land  in Canadian Airports. International  flights into Newfoundland.
LYNNE,"Sir, Don Rumsfeld on 3."
DICK,That?
LYNNE,You have authorization to shoot  down any aircraft deemed a threat.
GEORGE TENET,Presidential authority?
RUMSFELD,That’s correct. All orders are  UNODIR.
CONDI RICE,UNODIR?
GEORGE TENET,Unless otherwise directed.
RICHARD CLARKE,Mr. Vice President are we sure  these are the proper rules of  engagement.
RUMSFELD,"The country’s under attack, the ROE  is fluid. David?"
RICHARD CLARKE,Yes Mr. Vice President.
RUMSFELD,"Now we don't know what exactly what  the people in that room were thinking, but it's safe to assume  that at least one person wondered  why, in the midst of the most  fateful day in American history,  was Dick Cheney talking to his  lawyer?"
RICHARD CLARKE,"...Mr. Vice President, the  Congressional Members you sent to  Mount Weather Emergency Operations  Center want to leave."
COLIN POWELL,No.
GEORGE TENET,Excuse me?
RUMSFELD,"They’re not going anywhere. Just  tell them, we’ve got all the  helicopters."
CHENEY,"Yes, sir."
W BUSH,Are we at war?
COLIN POWELL,Yes we are.
DICK,With who?
W BUSH,We’ve picked up chatter from well- known Al Qaeda operatives  celebrating today’s attack.
DICK,We shouldn’t rule out Iraq.
SECRET SERVICE AGENT,What’s Al Qaeda’s Leader’s name?
SECRET SERVICE AGENT #2,His name is Osama Bin Laden
SECRET SERVICE AGENT,But this is clearly Al Qaeda. I’ve  been tracking their movements for  years. They’re fingerprints are all  over this.
DICK,Iraq has all the good targets.
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER,Iraq has NOTHING to do with this.
DICK (SOT),Richard you don’t know that for  sure--
INTELLIGENCE OFFICER,I do know that.
DICK,"Mr. President, if I may,  Afghanistan is Al Qaeda’s  headquarters. This is where our  focus should be."
SLOW PUSH IN ON CHENEY’S FACE AS HE HEARS THE RAW INTEL BEING,And the CIA  would be capable of  taking down the Taliban’s power  structure.
VOICES,"With all do respect, George. Mr.  President. We are the Pentagon.  This is what we do."
LYNNE,Don...
DICK,Okay... We’ll go with Tenet and the  CIA for now.
LYNNE,I’ll make calls to our allies.
NARRATOR,"I think given the current situation  Mr. President, it’s wise that you  and I not be in the same location.  For, uh, COG...Continuity of  Government."
DAVID ADDINGTON,"Of course, of course... Hey... Are  we going to be alright?"
JOHN YOO,Yes sir. We are.
DICK (SOT),"Angler has taken off to an  undisclosed location. I repeat,  Angler is airborn."
DAVID ADDINGTON,Angler? That’s the VP? I thought  only the President could land and  take off from the south lawn?
JOHN YOO,What can I tell you? Today’s  fucked.
NARRATOR (V.O.),"This intelligence has been edited,  redacted and reduced."
NARRATOR,"Mr. Vice President, usually we vet  the daily intelligence threat  matrix to eliminate unreliable  sources, non-players-"
GEORGE TENET,Stop. Don’t you dare give me a damn  disquisition on what I cannot hear.
DICK,Mr. President a lot of this  information is not verified.
GEORGE TENET,This is the last time I’ll say it.  I want to hear everything. Every  day. From now on.
ADDINGTON,"READ BY THE GROUP. The collage of intel becomes denser and  denser, mixed with static ridden Arabic and other languages."
RUMSFELD,"We’re tracking the possibility of  Bio-attacks using serin gas, cow  pox, ebola... There was a post on a  dark web site about mass be- headings in residential  neighborhoods.... Plans were found  outlining the use of infants as  suicide bombs in major airports...  A source has told as asset about  fire bombs targeting hospitals... A  video was captured describing  televised executions interrupting  American network TV... Movie  studios, museums, subways, day care  centers may all be targets... etc."
W BUSH,I’m scared Dick...
ADDINGTON,I’ll always keep you safe.
CHENEY,What are you going to do?
TRANSLATOR,"So while Powell, the CIA and their  international coalition toppled the  Taliban and took Afghanistan in a  matter of days... Cheney had found  something much more powerful than  missiles or jet planes."
CIA AGENT,"Mr. Vice President, this is John  Yoo."
4. A MAN WITH HIS WIFE AND KIDS IN FRONT OF HIM. A CIA AGENT,It’s a pleasure to meet you Mr.  Vice President.
CIA AGENT (CONT’D),Mmm huh.
TRANSLATOR#2,The Vice President believes that it  is the duty as Commander in Chief  to protect that Nation. And that no  other obligation whether it be  Congress or existing treaties  supersedes that duty... How do you  feel about that statement?
NARRATOR,I couldn’t agree more.
WAITER,"John Yoo’s first legal opinion  allowed the US government to  monitor every citizen’s phone  calls, texts and emails without a  warrant. It was a giant legal leap  based on sketchy law at best."
WAITER (CONT'D),"But their masterpiece, their Moby  Dick if you will, was the torture memo."
DONALD RUMSFELD,But what about the Geneva  Convention?
WAITER,We believe the Geneva Convention is  open to... interpretation.
DICK,What exactly does that mean?
WAITER,"Stress positions, water boarding,  confined spaces, dogs."
PAUL WOLFOWITZ,We’re calling it enhanced  interrogation.
FOCUS GROUP LEADER,We’re sure none of this fits under  the definition of torture?
PAUL WOLFOWITZ,The U.S. doesn’t torture.
RUMSFELD,"Therefore, if the U.S. does it, by  definition, it can’t be torture."
FOCUS GROUP LEADER,Just tell us what targets are next!  What targets are next?!
60 YEAR OLD GUY,All of this ends the second you  tell us the truth!!
FOCUS GROUP LEADER,SCREAMS AT HIM.
19 YR OLD GIRL,We will rape and kill your wife and  children ! Do you fucking hear me!!?
FOCUS GROUP LEADER,"But torture and privacy laws  weren’t the only laws Cheney  rewrote with John Yoo. They had a  full menu of opinions challenging  Constitutional and International  law,"
FOCUS GROUP LEADER (CONT’D),"Tonight we are offering the enemy  combatant: whereby someone is not a  criminal or a prisoner of war.  Which gives them no protection  under the law. We are also have  Extreme Rendition where suspects  are abducted without record, on  foreign soil and taken to foreign  prisons in countries that torture."
60 YEAR OLD GUY,"We have Guantanamo Bay which is  very, very complicated but allows  you to operate outside the purview  of due process on land that isn’t  technically US soil, but is under  our control."
FOCUS GROUP LEADER,That sounds delicious!
PAUL WOLFOWITZ,"And there is a very fresh and  delicious War Powers Act  interpretation, which gives the  executive branch broad power to  attack any country or person that  might possibly be a threat. Finally  for desert we have the fact that  under the unitary executive theory  if the President does anything it  makes it legal. In other words you  can do whatever the fuck you want.  So which would you like gentlemen?"
RUMSFELD,We’ll have them all.
ADDINGTON,Excellent choice.
DICK,"Look Dick, we’ve been using focus  groups and advertising executives  to help us sell this war on terror."
DICK,"I do want to reiterate, we are  still being recorded and there  still may or may not be clients  behind the door."
W BUSH,These guys are pretty sharp.
DOUGLAS FEITH,There’s a problem. The results show  that people are confused.
WOMAN,"So you’re saying you support the  President and you hate terrorism,  but you’re confused. Can you tell  me why?"
GUY IN HIS SIXTIES,Don’t we just have to get Osama bin  Laden? He did it. So why are they  calling it a war? A war with who?
DOUGLAS FEITH,Thank you Mark. Yes Jasmine?
PAUL WOLFOWITZ,I don’t get what this Al Qaeda is.  Are they a country? Why can’t we  just bomb them?
DOUGLAS FEITH,Interesting. Who else isn’t  entirely sure what Al Queda is?
CONDI RICE,Would it be less confusing if it  was a country?
JEFF SESSIONS (SOT),Damn right. I’m angry as hell. We  gotta fuck someone up.
CHENEY,"Really strong feelings from Mark,  I’m interested. Who agrees with  this statement?"
BILL O’REILLY (SOT),They know we’re at war but they  don’t understand against who.
REP. MIKE PENCE,They want a country. It’s simpler.  Cleaner.
SEN. HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON (SOT),That would certainly help us  legally.
PM TONY BLAIR (SOT),Looks like it’s time to take Iraq.
JEFF PROBST (SOT),"It’s called the Office of Special  Plans. Tenet is not yet serious  enough about the threat Saddam  poses in the GWOt, or global war on  terror. But I can promise you this  intelligence group will be."
KAREN HUGHES,I’ve been wanting to take that  motherfucker Saddam down for a long  time.
POWELL,I’ve got something! Here’s a report  that Mohamed Atta one of the  hijackers may have met with an  Iraqi spy in Prague.
W BUSH,"Wait, we can’t just bomb people."
RICE,Give me a break!
W BUSH,It’s from Czech intelligence and  they question its credibility...
KARL ROVE,I’ve been to Prague. They question  everything.
COLIN POWELL,Who wants to be an “unnamed  source?”
RUMSFELD,Make sure to get in the phrase “we  don’t want the smoking gun to be a  mushroom cloud.” It focus grouped  through the roof!
COLIN POWELL,The problem with Saddam is that  there will always be uncertainty  about when he will acquire nuclear  weapons. But we don’t want the  smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.
RUMSFELD,..whether it’s a smoking gun or a  mushroom cloud.
COLIN POWELL RUMSFELD (CONT'D),There is no question that Saddam  Hussien has Weapons of Mass  distruction.
GEORGE W,We gotta get rid of this dictator.  He’s got anthrax. He’s got all  these weapons.
DICK,"And not if, but when, Saddam uses  weapons of mass destruction, what  will we tell the American People."
GEORGE W,Saddam Hussien will increase his  capacity to wage biological and  chemical warfare.
COLIN POWELL,..we will stand up for what we know  to be right. To show that we will  confront the tyrannies and  dictatorships and terrorists who  put our way of life at risk.
GEORGE TENET,The tribe has spoken
RUMSFELD,Polling for an invasion of Iraq is  at 53%. Focus groups show people  still aren’t sure about a  connection between Saddam and Al  Qaeda.
DICK,France and Germany have said they  won’t join the coalition. Neither  will Israel.
GEORGE TENET,We went to the wall together. We  prayed together.  Israel is one of  our closest allies.
NARRATOR (V.O.),"They said an invasion of Iraq would  destabilize the region, Sir. And  they don’t view Saddam as an  immediate threat."
NARRATOR,That’s not good. I really want a  strong coalition for this.
DICK,I have an idea. Secretary Powell  has the highest trustworthy ratings  of any of us. What if he gave an  address to the U.N. and the  American people to push this over  the finish line?
FEMALE CIA ANALYST,"Karl, I’ve been very vocal, very  vocal, about my reservations about  invading Iraq."
DICK,"Oh Colin, you’re such a nervous  Nellie."
COLIN POWELL,We’re talking about invading a  sovereign nation without  provocation Don!
LAWRENCE WILKERSON,"Oh, sovereign nation..."
COLIN POWELL,"What about the intelligence. Oh come on! You know you’re  Has anybody thought about the wrong, you’re just a chicken  intelligence? You break it, shit.  you bought it. You break it,  you bought it!"
LAWRENCE WILKERSON,"Hey, hey, hey, alright.  Let’s slow  down. That’s enough of that guys."
SCOOTER LIBBY,Are you going to take Saddam down  or not. You’re the President. War  is yours. Not the U.N. Or some  coalition. Do not share powers that  are yours alone.
DAVID ADDINGTON,"George, make sure Powell sees the  intelligence. Colin I want you to  make that speech. I’m the President  and I want this to happen!"
NARRATOR (V.O.),"Yes, sir. I look forward to being  briefed on that intelligence."
JOSCHKA FISCHER,"On another note, I’ve been handed a  credible report that there’s a  small terrorist enclave in  Northeastern Iraq. If we’re going  to invade we recommend taking it  out before."
COLIN POWELL,"Let it go, George, we have bigger  fish to fry."
POWELL,Excuse me George. May I see that  intelligence?
NARRATOR (V.O.),Of course.
POWELL,That classified document described  a terrorist named Abu Musab Al-  Zarqawi who had started as a drug  dealer and pimp before becoming  fully radicalized in a Jordanian  prison.
NARRATOR (V.O.),"Zarqawi went to meet Bin Laden in  Afghanistan. But Zarqawi had vowed  to kill all Shia Muslims and Bin  Laden's mother was Shia, so the  meeting didn’t go well"
ZARQAWI,Did he or did he not meet with Al  Qaeda?
NARRATOR (V.O.),They had no operational contact.
OTHER TERRORISTS,Hogwash.
POWELL,Larry have you read this speech?!
NARRATOR (V.O.),Yes. It’s beyond thin. I saw five  pieces of disproved intel in there.
NARRATOR (V.O.),Who wrote it?
POWELL,They claimed it was from the  President but I think you can guess  who really wrote it.
MARY,"There’s no need to yell Larry. Yes,  we reviewed the speech and gave  some notes..."
DICK,Powell really doesn’t have a clue  does he?
MARY,"After the US invaded Afghanistan  Zarqawi set up shop in Iraq. It was  the only connection Cheney had  between Al Qaeda and Iraq, and  Cheney made sure Zarqawi’s name was  all over Powell’s speech."
LIZ,The Security Counsel will now begin  its consideration of item 2 of the  agenda. I now call the  distinguished Secretary of State of  the United States Mr. Colin Powell.
MARY LIZ (CONT'D),My purpose today is to share with  you what the United States knows  about Iraq's weapons of mass  destruction as well as Iraq's  involvement in terrorism...
LIZ (CONT’D),"Iraq today harbors a deadly  terrorist network headed by Abu  Musab Zarqawi, an associate and  collaborator of Osama Bin Laden and  his Al Qaeda lieutenants."
DICK,Powell’s UN Address was seen by  millions of Americas. But other  people were watching as well.
DICK (CONT’D),Zarqawi's activities are not  confined to this corner of  Northeast Iraq.
LIZ DICK (CONT'D),The great general of America saying  his name over and over again  immediately made Zarqawi a star.
LYNNE,Allah Akbar!
W BUSH,Within a day he had gone into  hiding.
AMERICAN TAILGATERS,Allah Akbar! Allah Akbar!
NARRATOR,...an Al-Qaeda source tells us that  Saddam and bin Laden reached an  understanding that Al-Qaeda would  no longer support activities  against Baghdad.
W BUSH,By the time we invaded Iraq 70% of  Americans thought that Saddam  Hussein was involved in 9/11.
GENERAL #1,Later Colin Powell would call the  speech the most shameful moment of his life.
GENERAL #1 (CONT'D),Thank you.
RUMSFELD,It was Kelly. And the Justin
DICK,What are you talking about?
WOLFOWITZ,American Idol.
NARRATOR,You’ve watched it. You’ve seen it.
KATHERINE ARMSTRONG,We watched it at your house. I watched it sitting next to  you.
NARRATOR (V.O.),The singing and mean judge.
HARRY WHITTINGTON,"Oh, I like him."
HARRY WHITTINGTON (CONT'D),How do you stop a fish from  smelling?
DICK,I don’t know. You cut off his nose.
SCOOTER LIBBY,"Ok, we aren’t going to revisit your  father’s colorful conversation."
DICK,"My fellow citizens, at this hour,  American and coalition forces are  in the early stages of military  operations to disarm Iraq, to free  its people and to defend the world  from grave danger. On my orders,  coalition forces have begun  striking selected targets of  military importance to undermine  Saddam Hussein's ability to wage  war. These are opening stages of  what will be a broad and concerted  campaign. To all of the men and  women of the United States armed  forces now in the Middle East, the  peace of a troubled world and the  hopes of an oppressed people now  depend on you."
SOLDIER #1,USA! USA! USA!
SOLDIER #2,Hi. Seems like they’ve been  shipping men and equipment out of  Afghanistan and into Iraq. And at  the moment we’re a little unsure of  what’s going on. I don’t want you  to worry about me.
SOLDIER #1,"Ladies and Gentlemen... Major  Combat operations in Iraq have  ended.  In the Battle of Iraq, the  United States and our allies have  prevailed."
RUMSFELD,We have concerns over Halliburton  KBR’s billing practices.
RUMSFELD,"As you know, the no-bid contracts  they received were quite sizable  and now-"
DICK,"Well, we’re not concerned. Are we?"
RUMSFELD,Not at all.
DICK,The Secretary of Defense and the  Vice President just said they’re  not concerned. Now can we please  talk about Iran?
RUMSFELD,"To this day, Dick Cheney has never  apologized for this incident."
SCOOTER LIBBY,Jesus Dick..
DICK,"But, someone else did."
NARRATOR (V.O.),My family and I are deeply sorry  for all that Vice President Cheney  and his family have had to go  through this past week. We send our  love and respect to them.
NARRATOR (V.O.),And we hope he will continue to  come to Texas and seek the  relaxation that he deserves.
NARRATOR (V.O.),This Joe Wilson asshole is  questioning our intelligence in the  New York Times? What’s his wife’s  name?
NARRATOR,Valerie Plame. I confirmed it.  She’s undercover CIA.
NARRATOR (V.O.),Leak it...
NARRATOR (V.O.),"Okay, okay, like... they don’t care  about their dogs. They’ll shoot em,  let em run wild... What kind of  people don’t love a dog?"
NARRATOR (V.O.),People in India love cows. They  would look at us and how we treat  cows and think the same thing.
SNIPPETS OF NEWSCASTERS (V.O.),"Captain, with all due respect that  is some liberal ass scratchin  bullshit if ever I’ve heard it-"
PATRICK LEAHY,Linda-
DICK,Look at this crap.
ANNOUNCER (V.O.),Hello Don.
NEWS SNIPPETS (V.O.),"That report says Zarqawi, the same  fucking Zarqawi we talked up for  months, is leading a major  insurgency in Iraq. And the  implication is it’s because we  talked him up!"
RUMSFELD (O.C.),Has POTUS seen this?
RUMSFELD,No I intercepted it before it got  across the  hallway.
DICK,This is generated by an analyst.
RUMSFELD,Get me Tenet. This stops here.
DICK,Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi had taken his  fame from Powell's UN speech and  taken it into his own new thing.
RUMSFELD,"The Islamic state of Iraq and  Levant, or ISIS."
DICK,"And because that intelligence  somehow found itself on the bottom  of a stack of papers, Zarqawi had a  whole year to do whatever the hell  he wanted."
RUMSFELD,And what he wanted was carnage.
RUMSFELD (CONT’D),"Shia versus Sunni, the West versus  Islam and death versus life."
DICK,And on top of that US forces  couldn't find any WMD's or nuclear  programs in Iraq.
RUMSFELD,Turns out that Saddam and his son's  mostly liked cocaine and American  movies from the 80's.
RUMSFELD (CONT’D),Vice President Cheney is being sued  by Valerie Plame and her husband  Joseph Wilson.... The White House  announced four cabinet  resignations...
DICK,Hey Dick. I hope there’s no hard  feelings about us investigating the  no-bid Iraq contracts for  Halliburton. Just doing my job.
RUMSFELD,Go fuck yourself.
NARRATOR,Dick Cheney low and outside with  that pitch.
DOCTOR,Some nations accusing Bush and  Cheney of war crimes... There is a  chorus of people calling for Dick  Cheney to step aside and resign.
LYNNE,Go away !
DICK CHENEY,"I wanted a clean phone line so I’m  in an empty office. Listen, if we  can just get an air bombardment in  Iraq, it’ll make a statement and  give us political cover-"
MARY,It’s over Don.
LIZ,What’s that?
DICK,It’s over. The President wants you  to step down. He appreciates your  service.
NARRATOR,Does Bush’s kid want me out or do  you?
NARRATOR,I can’t win every fight Don.
NARRATOR (V.O.),You are a little piece of shit.
RECORDING (SOT),"Wow, how did you become such a cold  son of a bitch."
LIZ CHENEY,I’m sorry Don. I really am.
MALE NEWS ANCHOR,You know how I know you’re not?
LIZ CHENEY,Because I wouldn’t be.
MALE NEWS ANCHOR,Do you think they’ll prosecute us?
LIZ CHENEY,...Okay then.
MALE NEWS ANCHOR,Okay then.
LYNNE,"A few years later, Dick’s heart  trouble started up again. With no  donor available, he finally found  himself at death’s door."
MARY,I wish I had better news. Your  heart just isn’t pumping enough  oxygen to keep his vital organs  alive. Should I call for a  Minister?
LYNNE,"No. He’s not going anywhere. Dick  Cheney you are not going anywhere,  do you hear me?!"
LIZ,This may be the one time I can’t do  what your Mother says.
NURSE,I love you Daddy.
MARTHA,We love you so much...
DICK,I love my girls...
MARTHA,Dick Cheney told his family he was  ready to die and that he wasn’t  afraid. He told them he had lived a  full life. And he had zero regrets  about the choices-
DICK,"They say my heart could give him  another ten years. Cheney doesn’t  like to refer to it as someone  else’s heart, he likes to refer to  it as his NEW heart. And even  though I’m dead, it still makes me  feel pretty shitty."
MARTHA,"And so, when Liz decided to run for  one of Wyoming two senate seats  against Republican incumbent Mike  Enzi, our Dick was right there to  hopefully see the Cheney legacy of  power continue."
DICK,"Are you aware Wyoming Senate  candidate Liz Cheney supports gay  marriage? Her sister is married to  a woman and Liz refuses to support  a constitutional amendment banning  same sex marriage. Don’t you agree,  Wyoming deserves a Senator who  believes marriage is between a man  and a woman."
MARTHA,These calls went to every house in  Wyoming. Every single house.  I  will never win! What are we gonna  do?
MARTHA,We’re joined here today by Liz  Cheney who is running for the  Senate from the state of Wyoming.  According to one poll she is behind  by double digits. Welcome.
MARTHA (CONT'D),Thank you for having me here Chris.  And may I point out there are other  polls that have me much closer.
DICK,Your opponent Senator Mike Enzi  claims you support gay marriage. In part because you support your gay  sister’s union with her wife. How  do you respond?
MARTHA,"Let me make this very, very clear:  I do not support gay marriage. I  believe marriage is between a man  and a woman."
DICK,But you’ve always claimed gay  marriage is a state issue. Your  opponent claims this is an  equivocation.
DICK (CONT’D),I think she’s coming off very well.
DICK (CONT’D),I know Liz wouldn’t have done this  without you and Dad didn’t approve. I can’t believe you would do this.  I really thought there was a limit  to politics..
THEN AFTER AWHILE THEY ARE INTERRUPTED BY A HASH AND A,No now you’re just being  hysterical. I can’t talk to you  when you get this way. You need to  settle down.
TERRI,DAD?...
MARK,Patient’s heart rate is stable.  Blood pressure increasing...
TERRI,Hello Mr. Vice President.
TURNER,This must be the right place.
MARK,Nice to meet you.
TURNER,Pleasure.
TERRI,You can sit right there.
MARK,So is it gonna be just me on camera  or...
TERRI,Primarily you. It’ll cut back to  me. Eddie’s got you on the “A”  camera. Me on the B.
TURNER MARK,Two-thirds of Americans say the  Iraq war is not worth fighting.
FAST AND FURIOUS GIRL,And their looking at the value  gained at the cost of American  lives. And Iraqi lives.
