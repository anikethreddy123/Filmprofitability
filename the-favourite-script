ABIGAIL,Must you?
MRS MEG,Grab a hunk of bread. Sally will take you to clean up and then to her Ladyship.
ABIGAIL,This mud stinks.
SALLY,They shit in the street round here. Political commentary they call it.
SALLY,Go through here. Clean yourself up.
ABIGAIL,Thank you so much.
SARAH,I didn’t know the new sewer ended in here.
ABIGAIL,Lady Marlborough.
ABIGAIL,"It is I Abigail. Dear cousin. I had a letter from our aunt and... I’m sorry, I did not to mean to present as a ... I fell out of the carriage,.. and a man was pulling his... never mind the man. My letter from our aunt..."
SARAH,Friends of yours?
ABIGAIL,I am sorry... I.
SARAH,"Your name girl. If we are blood, name it."
ABIGAIL,Oh. I did not... Abigail Hill.
SARAH,The Somerset Hills?
GODOLPHIN,"The one who went mad and burnt his own house down, himself in it."
MARLBOROUGH,Lost all his money at whist.
GODOLPHIN,No one bets on whist.
SARAH,My uncle was one of a kind.
ABIGAIL,I apologise for my appearance I do. The staff led me here. A harmless prank of some sort I suspect.
SARAH,And you want?
ABIGAIL,I hoped I might be employed here by you... as something.
SARAH,A monster for the children to play with perhaps?
ABIGAIL,Yes. If you like.
SARAH,"Go back to that gouty old slattern Mrs Meg and tell her I said to give you quarters, food and something to do. Take your flies with you."
ANNE,How was my speech?
SARAH,You were brilliant.
ANNE,Did I have a lisp?
SARAH,You don’t lisp.
ANNE,"I know that’s what was troubling about it. The thought I suddenly did. Sarah, you must say hello to the little ones."
SARAH,No.
ANNE,Please?
SARAH,It is macabre. I love you but that I will not do.
ANNE,If you love me...
SARAH,Love has limits.
ANNE,It should not.
SARAH,You do not lisp but you are mad. Giving me a palace?!
ANNE,I’ve been wanting to get you something for a while. It seemed a good opportunity. Marlborough winning. Were the Tories alright about it? I couldn’t tell.
SARAH,It is a monstrous extravagance Mrs Morley. We are at war.
ANNE,We won.
SARAH,It is not over. We must continue.
ANNE,"Oh... I did not... know that. Well Mrs Freeman, you will... be clever as keeper of the privy purse... and afford it."
MARLBOROUGH,Gentleman! Ducks!
HARLEY,A palace!
SARAH,You seem angry at my good fortune. And I thought we were friends.
HARLEY,I really doubt you’ve made that mistake.
SARAH,Well I was actually just teasing. I thought you’d see that.
HARLEY,It will not stand.
SARAH,Well it will if I build it using the best craftsmen in the land. I hope it will stand for a hundred years as a symbol of my husband’s gallant victory.
HARLEY,"And I applaud your husband’s gallant victory. However considering the parlous state of the treasury, it seems something the Queen should have taken advice from the loyal opposition on."
SARAH,But then it would’ve lost that delightful surprise element. You know like Christmas morning? If St. Nicholas bills you first it loses its frisson.
HARLEY,Cunt!
SARAH,And there I was expecting something witty that rhymed.
GODOLPHIN,Horatio has done it again.
HARLEY,Prime Minister we need to discuss who will go to the French with the peace treaty proposal.
SARAH,We do not need a peace treaty. We have them on the run.
HARLEY,So they will give in to us.
GODOLPHIN,One battle will not win the war.
HARLEY,"I have held my party together, as we the country landowners have essentially paid for this entire war."
GODOLPHIN,And grateful we are.
HARLEY,While city merchants have enriched themselves from it.
MARLBOROUGH,Yet I do not see your fat tweedy dead when I look out on the field of battle.
HARLEY,We are out of money. My point.
GODOLPHIN,We will raise taxes again. THE FAVOURITE SHOOTING SCRIPT 6 MAR 17 8.
HARLEY,You would be wise to rethink that Godolphin. I helped unite parliament for this. I will not do it again.
SARAH,"The French are chastened but not defeated Harley. We must destroy them. Make them sue for peace, with broken backs and begging hearts."
HARLEY,What a sweet wife you have Marlborough.
MARLBOROUGH,Sweet. And right.
HARLEY,I cannot agree. We must take it to the Queen. If you would be kind enough to arrange a time Lady Marlborough.
SARAH,Of course.
ANNE,I am ready for the Russian ambassador.
SARAH,Who did your make up?
ANNE,We went for something dramatic. Do you like it?
SARAH,You look like a badger.
ANNE,Oh.
SARAH,You’re going to cry? Really?
SARAH,What do you think you look like?
ANNE,A badger.
SARAH,And do you really think you can meet the Russian delegation looking like that?
SARAH,I will manage it. Go back to your rooms.
ANNE,Thank you.
ANNE,Did you just look at me! Did you?!
ANNE,Do not avert your eyes! Shut them!
SALLY,Morning.
ABIGAIL,Oh hello. I was thinking of playing cards later if you would like to join me.
SALLY,Sounds brill. The old bag says you are to scrub the floor until she can see her toothless fat face in it.
SALLY,Sorry.
SALLY,You might need gloves. Lye is dangerous. It burns bad.
MRS MEG,You! Get the bandage box!
MRS MEG,Hurry! The Queen’s had an attack of gout.
ANNE,Sarah!
SARAH,I’m here. I’m here. Brandy!
ANNE,They hurt.
SARAH,I know my dearest I know. The beef!
SARAH,Gently cousin.
SARAH,It’s alright. Tell me a story.
ANNE,You two may go.
SARAH,"You, start wrapping that."
ANNE,I... can’t. I...
SARAH,How we first met. Tell me that. Come on.
SARAH,The... wretched... Cheever boy had me down on the ground and was holding me... dropping spittle in my face.
ANNE,He is still a pig. Then what?
ANNE,Then what?
SARAH,"I heard footsteps, fast footsteps, and saw these pink shoes running towards me..."
ANNE,".. and then they disappeared and I heard a crack. And then he fell off me, and I looked over and... ughh."
SARAH,Remember how his jaw just hung there?
SARAH,"I do. You took my hand and said ‘Hello, I’m Sarah. You’re covered in spittle. Let’s wash you off’."
ANNE,You must try to sleep.
SARAH,You may go.
ANNE,Don’t leave.
SARAH,I won’t.
ANNE,Are you still there?
SARAH,Yes.
ABIGAIL,Still?
FOOTMAN 1,Yes.
ABIGAIL,For the Queen. The doctor has ordered it immediately. It is a matter of extreme urgency
FOOTMAN 1,She’s sleeping.
ABIGAIL,Shall I tell the doctor you imperiled the Queens health and let you rue the ramifications.
SARAH,What does ramifi...mean.
ABIGAIL,It means he will have you whipped.
SARAH,What are you doing?
ABIGAIL,"I am... I... these are peleatis, the herb. I cut them this morning. They remove swelling and inflammation. I saw them and I thought it may help the Queen."
SARAH,You cannot just walk in here! Why did the footman let you through?
SARAH,I lied to him. It is not his fault. I just wanted to help her. She seemed to suffer so much.
MARLBOROUGH,Footman take her downstairs. Tell Mrs. Meg she is to receive six of the birch. Go!
ANNE,You must focus Anne. Much is at stake.
SARAH,We gather forces here. The Austrians mass here.
SARAH,Is that... which country again?
MARLBOROUGH,Listen!
GODOLPHIN,Marlborough.
SARAH,"This is the town of Lille, in a valley. We lure them in by sending a small force to engage them. They give chase. We descend in numbers from above them."
ANNE,Hear hear.
SARAH,"It is a brilliant plan. Queen Anne, you agree?"
ANNE,The people expect it to be over.
ANNE,"We all want it over, but wishing does not make it so Anne. We could sue for peace, but we will not get it."
SARAH,It does help.
ANNE,"Something soothing on my legs, it takes the burn out. What is it?"
ABIGAIL,Oh. Herbs. Of some sort. THE FAVOURITE SHOOTING SCRIPT 6 MAR 17 17.
MRS MEG,It’s nice. Thank you.
FOOTMAN ONE,No! Please!
SALLY,"Do her in the barn if that is what is, not in my kitchen."
SARAH OS,Her Ladyship says six of the birch for this one.
SARAH OS,"She really is a lady, look how soft that skin is."
SARAH,Stop!
SARAH,Let her up.
ABIGAIL,Follow me.
SARAH,So you are perhaps too kind for your own good.
ABIGAIL,It has been said.
SARAH,Which leads to stupidity. But the Queen is soothed somewhat so I thank you. You shall get me more of those herbs. And not overstep again.
SARAH,Yes Maam. My father always spoke highly of you.
ABIGAIL,"I liked your father, he had charm to burn. And then I guess he did."
SARAH,You have fallen far.
ABIGAIL,Yes. When I was fifteen my father lost me in a card game.
SARAH,You are not serious?
ABIGAIL,Oh he was very upset about it. Took off into the forest with nothing but a scullery maid and a dozen bottles for solace.
SARAH,And you went?
ABIGAIL,We honour our debts. They would have hurt him. THE FAVOURITE SHOOTING SCRIPT 6 MAR 17 19.
SARAH,Foolish. A woman should not let herself be chattel.
ABIGAIL,I wanted to do right by my father. The debt was to a balloon shaped German man with a thin cock. Thankfully I managed to convince him a woman has her blood in twenty eight days a month.
SARAH,What happened to your hand?
SARAH,Some of my colleagues are immune to my charms.
MADAME TOURNEE,"Earl Stratford, do not come near me whining today or I will crush your tiny heart to liver."
SARAH,Madame Tournee. You may have the tapestry budget you have asked for. Spend one penny more and I will take your finger nails in lieu.
ABIGAIL,Merci.
SARAH,"Abigail, get a platter of oysters sent to the Dutch Ambassador."
MASHAM,Yes your Ladyship.
SARAH,Colonel Masham.
MASHAM,Lady Marlborough.
SARAH,The Queen will ride on Tuesday morning.
HARLEY,"Yes, Lady Marlborough."
GODOLPHIN,Would you like a bite of my new maid before you leave?
HARLEY,Must the duck be here?
GODOLPHIN,"Fastest duck in the city. Horatio is a prize worth stealing, he does not leave my side."
HARLEY,Keep him away from me or I will pull his liver out and eat it with a cornichon.
GODOLPHIN,Charming.
HARLEY,"You should know, I have canvassed my party. They are waiting for us to announce an attempt at peace."
SARAH,We shall both make our case to the Queen.
HARLEY,Where is the Queen? We have been waiting an hour.
SARAH,I’m here.
GODOLPHIN,"Might I remind you, you are not the Queen."
SARAH,She has sent me to speak for her. She is unwell.
HARLEY,What says she?
SARAH,That Harley is a fop and a prat and smells like a ninety six year old French whore’s vajuju.
HARLEY,I really doubt you’re quoting.
SARAH,She has decided to continue with the war. She feels another victory in will put us in a stronger position for a treaty. Her letters.
HARLEY,And how are we to pay for this?
SARAH,The Land tax is to be doubled.
HARLEY,This is madness. The war you will be fighting will be in our own countryside.
SARAH,She relies on you and your love of England to hold the Tories together.
HARLEY,There are limits.
SARAH,To love of your country? To me there is no limit on that. Our last farthing to protect England if we must.
HARLEY,And our last man too? The dead pile up as do the resentments. Or that does not concern you?
GODOLPHIN,"I grieve them all, in my heart a scar for each, and I send my own beloved with them, chest bared. So do not lecture me on the cost. You do not count the cost in men until you need something heavy to toss on the scales with your greed."
HARLEY,A treaty would save money and lives. A win for all Englishman.
SARAH,"We go to them after one victory, they know we are scared. We bury more of them. They know we have them. The Queen has decided Harley."
HARLEY,I disagree...a lot! I would like an audience with her where I may state my case.
SARAH,"State it to me, I love a comedy. Is there cake?"
SARAH,This is a disgusting distortion of the system. You have no place in this!
GODOLPHIN,Your mascara is running. If you’d like to go fix yourself we can continue this later.
GODOLPHIN,You will need to pay for the repair of that. We have a war to finance. Every penny counts.
SARAH,"Come on, old bean. One more victory. Otherwise they will use the time it takes for a treaty negotiation to regroup. Mark my words."
GODOLPHIN,Must you rub it in? A man’s dignity is the thing that holds him back from running amok.
ABIGAIL,Sometimes a lady likes to have fun.
SARAH,We need to be careful Sarah. He is a useful ally and a dangerous enemy.
ABIGAIL,You are... extraordinary. A woman like no other.
SARAH,And you are astute and perspicacious. And perhaps something of a flatterer.
MASHAM,It is not flattery when it is fact. You are not scared of anyone.
MASHAM,Of course not.
ABIGAIL,Are you following me?
MASHAM,I said are you following me?
ABIGAIL,"You seem to be following me, sir, as I am in front of you."
MASHAM,That was you on the horse this morning.
ABIGAIL,"I am a servant, where would I get a horse? Perhaps you dreamt of me?"
HARLEY,Perhaps it was you and I should have you stripped and whipped.
MASHAM,I’m waiting.
HARLEY,Going to ride that one are we?
SARAH,She does make my blood hot. She is Lady Marlborough’s new one.
ABIGAIL,Indeed. Interesting.
SARAH,Borrow anything you want.
MARLBOROUGH,Thank you. And thank you for the job.
SARAH,I have a thing for the weak.
MARLBOROUGH,It is time.
SARAH,You must be safe. You must not be foolish and brave. Be smart and safe. I beg you.
MARLBOROUGH,I will.
SARAH,Stay with me tonight.
ANNE,I must sleep with my men. It is only right.
SARAH,"I had a dream that this very small Frenchman covered in blood, was carrying his head around feeding it brie."
ANNE,He is a great soldier.
ABIGAIL,He will be fine. We will prevail.
ANNE,Of course we will Mrs Freeman.
ABIGAIL,I am sorry Your Majesty. I think I caught a chill picking the herbs for your leg.
SARAH,That was you?
SARAH O/S,Abigail.
ABIGAIL,Let’s shoot something.
SARAH,Throw! THE FAVOURITE SHOOTING SCRIPT 6 MAR 17 27.
ABIGAIL,It’s sad really. They are so pretty.
SARAH,"Learn to fly faster, pretty will not save you bird."
ABIGAIL,Throw!
SARAH,You’re really doing damage to the sky.
ABIGAIL,Can I ask you something?
SARAH,As long as you are aware I have a gun.
ABIGAIL,"You fought hard for this war and your husband is at the front of it, his life at risk. How can you ... do that?"
SARAH,It is right. If we don’t do it they will gather force and be over here cutting us all into chops within the year. You are of a sweet disposition and have had some blows so desire safety and favour above all else.
ABIGAIL,If he dies?
SARAH,Did you not sacrifice your cunt to fatty German to save your father?
SARAH,...Yes. THE FAVOURITE SHOOTING SCRIPT 6 MAR 17 28.
ABIGAIL,There’s always a price to pay. I am prepared to pay it. Throw!
SARAH,"Just relax and aim. When it crosses your eye, pull the trigger."
HARLEY,Throw!
ANNE,Yes! Perfect! I will make a killer of you yet.
HARLEY,Your Majesty. How lovely to see you. It seems you have allocated even more money into the abyss that is this fool’s errand.
ANNE,Oh. Yes. We... will win. Sarah is sure we will win.
SARAH,This landholders tax. You have no idea the fire storm of rage you have set loose in the countryside.
ANNE,Really? They are angry?
SARAH,Dearest Queen.
HARLEY,How do you like the stockings?
SARAH,Festive.
HARLEY,"I was just explaining to the Queen the mistake this tax is, and the war as well. We should sue for peace."
ANNE,"Oh Harley, you’re such a bore. That is for parliament. A ball is for dancing and eating these venison and horseradish puffs. Have you tried these?"
HARLEY,I am having trouble swallowing at the moment. Your Majesty-
SARAH,I would like to enjoy the music now.
SARAH,Of course.
ANNE,Oh I love this music. I must dance.
ANNE,You.
SARAH,Stop it. Stop!
ANNE,I would like to go back to my room now!
ANNE,What has happened?
SARAH,Now!
ANNE,"Stop! Mr Harley, I agree I went too far with the tax for the war."
HARLEY,What?!
SARAH,We shall keep it as it was.
SARAH,We are your servants my Queen.
SARAH,"Anne, I’m sorry."
ANNE,It’s okay.
ANNE,Shall we go fast?
HARLEY,Give me your finger.
ABIGAIL,Fuck me.
HARLEY,Abigail isn’t it?
ABIGAIL,"Yes sir,..."
HARLEY,"Stole a book I see. Why, one could be stripped and whipped for that."
ABIGAIL,My mistress lent it to me.
HARLEY,Shall we go ask her?
HARLEY,No!
ABIGAIL,Come and take the night air with me.
HARLEY,"So you once were a lady and now you are a nothing, a bit of scullery scraps. How very sad."
ABIGAIL,I am still the lady I was. In my heart.
HARLEY,No doubt. It is important to make new friends is it not?
ABIGAIL,"Yes. If that is what is actually happening here, and not veiled threats under the guise of civility."
HARLEY,Am I to understand you are smart?
ABIGAIL,You want something. To fuck me?
HARLEY,"I will leave that to my friend Masham, who is completely cuntstruck by you. So tell me about Lady Marlborough, Godolphin, the Queen. Anything going on? I love gossip. It’s a failing I know."
HARLEY,"Lady Marlborough has been good to me, she has saved me. I will not breach her confidence."
ABIGAIL,"Of course. You are in favour. But favour is a breeze that shifts direction all the time. Then in an instant you’re back sleeping with a bunch of scabrous whores wondering whose finger’s in your arse. You cannot have too many friends in court. I need a friend Abigail, one with cute ears and wide eyes. I am often blind-sided by the distorted situation at court. As Leader of the Opposition I should not be. THE FAVOURITE SHOOTING SCRIPT 6 MAR 17 33."
HARLEY,"I would merely like to know of any plans her Ladyship, Godolphin or the Queen may have."
HARLEY,I will not betray my mistress’s trust.
HARLEY,Oh look a wren. How cute.
HARLEY,Are you alright? Let me help you up.
SARAH,Thing is if you’re not my friend. You are..
ANNE,"... by definition my enemy. Anyway, think on it. No pressure."
SARAH,You will have to tell Harley you have changed your mind about the tax.
ANNE,Can’t you do that?
SARAH,I am not the Queen.
ANNE,...are the people really angry about the land tax?
SARAH,They’ll be angrier when the French are sodomising their wives and planting their fields with garlic.
SARAH,The Tories must not be rode roughshod over though. And...more dead if we do it.
ANNE,"It is painful to lose men, but we cannot be half hearted in this or they will see our weakness and take us and we will lose thousands more. We must be strong Anne. It hangs in the balance and the tipping point is courage."
SARAH,None for the Queen.
ANNE,What?
SARAH,"You cannot have hot chocolate. Your stomach, the sugar inflames it."
ABIGAIL,Abigail hand me the cup.
SARAH,Do not.
ANNE,"I’m sorry, I do not know what to...."
SARAH,"Fine, give it to her, and then go get a bucket and a mop for the aftermath."
ABIGAIL,Take me back.
SARAH,You will pronounce the tax in parliament. I will set the date.
ABIGAIL,I must tell you something.
SARAH,Go on.
ABIGAIL,"Mr Harley came to me. He asked me to betray your confidences, about what goes on between you and the Queen and Godolphin."
SARAH,I see. And what will you do?
ABIGAIL,I... am not going to! Obviously.
SARAH,Not obviously. You may tell me of his approach to encourage my trust and still work both sides of the street.
ABIGAIL,"I am a person of honour even if my station is not. Even if I were to be the last one left in this wretched place, I would remain a lady!"
SARAH,You are pretty when outraged. So my secrets are safe with you?
ABIGAIL,All of them.
SARAH,Good.
SARAH,Even your biggest secret.
ABIGAIL,Abigail.
SARAH,"If you forget to load the pellet the gun fires, makes the sound, but releases no shot. It is a great jape do you agree?"
ABIGAIL,Yes.. great.
MRS MEG,Maybe we will think of some use for it one day. Sometimes it is hard to remember if you have loaded the pellet or not. I do fear confusion and accidents.
SARAH,I’m sure people will be careful.
SARAH,Twelve guineas for beef.
MADAME TOURNEE,Madame Tournee.
SARAH,The Winter Ball. Your expenses are out of control!
MADAME TOURNEE,"Madame is an artiste and art is like a cloud, it floats and gathers force as it must before it rains joy."
SARAH,Let it rain at the cost of eight guineas instead of fifty.
MRS MEG,But...
HARLEY,Cream. Mrs Meg your cream bill is outrageous. Are you bathing in it to help your hemorrhoids?
SARAH,No your Ladyship. THE FAVOURITE SHOOTING SCRIPT 6 MAR 17 38.
HARLEY,May I examine?
SARAH,Of course.
SARAH,Perfect Lady Marlborough. As always.
ANNE,Shall we sign off?
SARAH,Aim for the flagstones. The lawn may break your fall.
ANNE,You do not care!
SARAH,Mrs Morley. Please.
ANNE,Ow! Just stay for a little while! No! Take the day off. I command it.
ANNE,Someone must run things!
SARAH,I am not food! You cannot just eat and eat!
SARAH,And yet you are tasty.
GODOLPHIN,"And salty. And if I grilled you, you would make a delightful meal."
ANNE,You are... incorrigible.
ABIGAIL,Fine. I will come and play Whist with you this afternoon.
ANNE,"The opposition asks us to be halfhearted in this war! We will not! We must wear our griefs for England is worth our all, and suffer we must to save her! Mr Harley control your rabble!"
ABIGAIL,About time Mrs Freeman. This fucking leg! It is like a monster attacking me. Cut it off for me will you? THE FAVOURITE SHOOTING SCRIPT 6 MAR 17 40.
ANNE,I do not think so your Majesty.
ABIGAIL,Why are you here?
ANNE,"Lady Marlborough sent me as I am an excellent Whist player and she has been unavoidably detained with the business of state, but will be here post haste."
ABIGAIL,It’s my state! I am the business of state. Did she actually send me her maid?!
ANNE,"As I am standing here I am going to assume that’s rhetorical. Your Majesty I wasn’t always a maid. I am educated, speak French, Latin. My family fell on hard times. I am also her cousin."
ABIGAIL,"Very fascinating, but you shall leave regardless and tell her to come."
ANNE,Oh! They are gorgeous.
ABIGAIL,My babies. Let them out please.
ANNE,How many are there?
ABIGAIL,Seventeen. It’s Hildebrand’s day today.
ANNE,Which one is he?
ANNE,"That one. Shy, but stubborn."
ABIGAIL,May I?
ANNE,"He likes you. I lost some seventeen children. Some born as blood, some without breath, and some just briefly with me."
ANNE,Oh my dear.
ABIGAIL,"Today is Hildebrand’s... day. The day, you lost him."
MASHAM,"Each one that dies, something of you goes with them."
ABIGAIL,Would you like to join me?
MASHAM,What an outfit.
ABIGAIL,Why thank you. I thought it might be too much.
MASHAM,Have you come to seduce me or rape me?
ABIGAIL,I am a gentleman.
ABIGAIL,So rape then.
MASHAM,No. You are a... You have intrigued me.
ABIGAIL,"And you, me. I am intrigued by what you look like under this."
MASHAM,You are handsome. No wonder you cover it up. Women would swoon and nothing would get done.
ABIGAIL,Who are you? No ordinary maid.
ABIGAIL,It could be said I have fallen far.
HARLEY,It could be said I aim to catch you.
MASHAM,I might allow it.
HARLEY,Now good night sir.
MASHAM,Progress?
HARLEY,She bit me. And this wig is ridiculous.
ANNE,A man must look pretty.
SARAH,I’m not entirely sure she approves.
ANNE,Try again in your own way old boy.
SARAH,Ow.
SARAH,Apologies regarding sending Abigail in my stead.
ANNE,She was perfectly darling. Hildebrand really took to her.
SARAH,Is that a rabbit?
SARAH,Anne. You are too sensitive.
SARAH,And you are too uncaring and mean some days.
ABIGAIL,Some days I’m quite lovely though. Let’s think of them.
ANNE,Anne!
ABIGAIL,You are such a child!
ANNE,"I guess all the rapes were the hardest. Made me feel at their mercy, that I was nothing."
ABIGAIL,You are not nothing. You are a dear person.
ANNE,Thank you. You are so beautiful.
ABIGAIL,Stop it. I am... you mock me.
ANNE,I do not. If I was a man I would ravish you. Rrrrravish.
ABIGAIL,Enough!
ANNE,I am sorry. Oh look.
ANNE,Make them stop.
ABIGAIL,What?
ANNE,Stop! Enough! Stop!
ANNE,Enough!
ABIGAIL,Your Majesty?
ANNE,Depart! All of you!!
ANNE,I must rest.
WOMAN,Shall I...
ANNE,Leave me be!
PAGE ONE,Give me that!
ANNE,Your Majesty I-
ABIGAIL,Where am I? Where am I?
ANNE,Your Majesty. You are in the west hallway.
ABIGAIL,How dare you speak to me like that?!
ANNE,Your Majesty.
ABIGAIL,Where did you go? Stupid girl.
ANNE,I’m sorry.
ABIGAIL,Take me back.
SARAH,Perhaps we should dance.
ABIGAIL,You mock me!
SARAH,"No. I just believe you can, that it would be cheering. And I would dearly like to dance with you."
ABIGAIL,Twelve. Eleven. You are shooting exceptionally well Abigail.
SARAH,You have taught me well.
ABIGAIL,I hope you have not found your time with the Queen too tedious.
SARAH,Not at all. And if it gives you rest I am happy. Did you sleep well?
ABIGAIL,Like a shot badger.
SARAH,Excellent.
ABIGAIL,"The Queen is... an extraordinary person, even if it is not readily apparent. She has been stalked by tragedy."
SARAH,She seems quite lovely.
ABIGAIL,I will not burden you again.
ABIGAIL,I am quite happy to-
ABIGAIL,I know you are. She will be angry if I do not appear soon. Take your shot.
SARAH,Throw!
SARAH,Thirteen. THE FAVOURITE SHOOTING SCRIPT 6 MAR 17 49.
PAGE TWO,Don’t know what came over me.
ANNE,The Queen? I will be there directly.
SARAH,What?
ANNE,The Queen... asks for ...her.
SARAH,"I have brought us up some lobsters, we will race them and then eat them!"
ANNE,I hope you have three.
ANNE,"Oh, hello."
SARAH,Well hello. You sent for Abigail to try and make me jealous I think.
SARAH,Perhaps.
MEG,They will be in with the lobsters in a minute. THE FAVOURITE SHOOTING SCRIPT 6 MAR 17 50.
HARLEY,Scared?
ABIGAIL,I think a moat is a bad idea. It is too old fashioned.
HARLEY,"Maam, three rude and unruly crustaceans. Best with butter and lemon than to be played with, but as you will your majesty."
ABIGAIL,Hello. Remember me?
HARLEY,Mr Harley. You always unbalance me.
ABIGAIL,So what’s been happening?
HARLEY,The Queen and Lady Marlborough are to race lobsters and then eat them.
ABIGAIL,Do you want to get punched?
HARLEY,The Queen will announce the doubling of the landholders tax to Parliament.
ABIGAIL,Do you jest?
HARLEY,I do not think she is certain of it though. THE FAVOURITE SHOOTING SCRIPT 6 MAR 17 51.
ABIGAIL,But Lady Marlborough is providing that certainty.
HARLEY,Yes.
ABIGAIL,And?
HARLEY,That is all.
HARLEY,Why do I feel that is not all?
HARLEY,"I am trying my best, I am."
HARLEY,"Alright, alright, turn off the tears. Thank you. Have a pleasant evening."
ABIGAIL,"May I speak a moment, with Her Majesty’s pleasure? May I exhort the chamber to roar a mighty hurrah for Her Majesty in her brilliant decision to not raise the land tax."
MASHAM,"For the doubling of the tax would have been a disaster, and the fields would have run with blood as the countryside rose up against our city friends. To add to the piling dead of our sons on the field of this war. Again to our Queen for her deep wisdom in knowing where to draw the line in holding our country together. For there is no point winning a war abroad if we are to start one at home."
ABIGAIL,I apologise for the interruption Your Majesty. The floor is yours of course. We look forward to hearing what you have to say.
ABIGAIL,Who’s there?
MASHAM,Boo!
ABIGAIL,Men should not sneak up on women.
MASHAM,You look scared.
ABIGAIL,I am hurt. Look.
MASHAM,I have just now decided to marry you Masham.
ABIGAIL,I cannot marry a servant. I can enjoy one though. THE FAVOURITE SHOOTING SCRIPT 6 MAR 17 53.
ABIGAIL,I know it would ruin you to marry me. I will fix things for us.
ABIGAIL,Who says I would marry you?
MASHAM,I am in your blood and you will not rest until I am pinned underneath you. But I will decide if and when that occurs.
ABIGAIL,Say it is not so.
MASHAM,Don’t you think we are a good match?
ABIGAIL,I think a very good match.
ANNE,"Wait, kiss me properly first."
SARAH,I am enthralled by you.
ANNE,Of course you are. I am stealing your horse now.
SARAH,I looked like a fool. They were all staring weren’t they? I can tell even if I cannot see. And I heard the word fat. Fat.
ANNE,Anne.
SARAH,And ugly.
SARAH,"No one but me would dare, and I did not. I felt for you. He set you up. It is our fault."
GODOLPHIN,I did not know what else to do. I could not... go through with it.
SARAH,It’s fine Anne. It’s fine.
ABIGAIL,He was ready for us.
ANNE,He probably just assumed you would have been working on the Queen.
ABIGAIL,A minor hitch. We will reset the date.
ANNE,Oh Your Majesty.
ABIGAIL,What are you doing?
ANNE,"Lady Marlborough asked me to wait for you and I was... and then the bed looked so beautiful and I was overcome... with, with foolishness. I am sorry."
ABIGAIL,You may get out now.
FOOTMAN 2,Apologies again Your Majesty.
ANNE,What happened to your dress?
ABIGAIL,Wolves.
ANNE,Her legs.
ANNE,Rub my legs.
GODOLPHIN,Does it hurt a lot?
GODOLPHIN,It is agony.
SARAH,Oh the pain.
GODOLPHIN,"Marlborough has written. He is in position, the battle will begin any time."
SARAH,He will prevail.
SARAH,Of course.
ABIGAIL,"I imagine you will not sleep tonight. I can stay and sit with you? I could regale you with witty tales of my romantic exploits, and by exploits I mean humiliations, and some weeping."
SARAH,You are sweet Godolphin which may explain the humiliations. I am alright.
ABIGAIL,Mrs Morley?
SARAH,Good morning Lady Marlborough
ABIGAIL,Where is that book of poetry from the Dryden fellow?
SARAH,I do not-
ABIGAIL,No! No! NO!
SARAH,I do not understand. THE FAVOURITE SHOOTING SCRIPT 6 MAR 17 58.
ABIGAIL,Did you take it? My book!
SARAH,No I-
ABIGAIL,I think you are a pretty little liar that I have misjudged.
SARAH,"I did not mean for this to happen. The Queen, she is forceful and -"
SARAH,"You are dismissed from my service. Go back to Mrs Meg tell her to find you a position in the scullery. If she asks why, tell her ‘Because I am a disloyal little bitch’."
ANNE,As you wish your Ladyship. It has been my privilege and honour to -
SARAH,"If you do not go, I will start kicking you and I will not stop."
SARAH,You have become close to Abigail.
ANNE,She has been a dear. Yes.
ANNE,It is such a shame but I have dismissed her for theft. She is a liar and a thief.
SARAH,Your tongue seems uncharacteristically still.
ANNE,I heard you.
SARAH,"She is my servant, she is not dismissed. I have made her my Maid of the Bedchamber."
ANNE,Did you not hear what I said?
SARAH,You regard her as a liar and a thief.
ANNE,Yes!
ANNE,I do not. Obviously.
CROWD 1 O/S,You will dismiss her.
CROWD 2 O/S,I will not. I like it when she puts her tongue inside me.
ANNE,Go!
CROWD 3 O/S,It’s that fucking bitch! My sons a cripple you cunt!
ABIGAIL,Stop the carnage you stuck up whore!
ANNE,Don’t they know who it is?
CROWD 4 O/S,Queen cunt!
ANNE,I think they do.
ABIGAIL,Oh.
ANNE,Warmongering Slag!
ABIGAIL,What are they shouting?
ANNE,Driver! Faster!
ABIGAIL,Close your eyes. Sing a song with me. Will you be my Love? Do you know it? It is marvellous.
ANNE,It is so strange to be in this.
SARAH,It is good for you. The doctor says it will leach the toxins.
SARAH,What if I go to sleep and slip under?
ABIGAIL,Just imagine it is hot chocolate.
SARAH,At least I would die happy.
ANNE,"After you left I thought, what a grand idea to take to the mud. To get whatever poisons one carries with one out."
SARAH,Abigail could you fetch me some refreshment? THE FAVOURITE SHOOTING SCRIPT 6 MAR 17 62.
ANNE,I would like of course but I must be at the Queen’s side and behest at all times. It is my role.
SARAH,Such loyalty. How delightful it is when one tries to cultivate a new trait in one’s character.
ANNE,Do not scratch at her.
SARAH,Mr Freeman.
SARAH,Mr Morley.
SARAH,How handsome you are.
ANNE,"Oh Mr Freeman, you are handsome."
ABIGAIL,Oh but I forgot my glasses.
SARAH,You will be back in the street.
ABIGAIL,"Remember when we were young and were not allowed out in the snow, and we opened all the windows in the ballroom and sat there as snow flurries just wafted in. And when your governess came in we were making a snowman and our hands were blue."
ANNE,Oh that was such fun.
ABIGAIL,Sounds marvellous.
SARAH,So many things we have done together.
ABIGAIL,I do love ancient history.
ANNE,"Abigail, did you say something?"
ABIGAIL,I was singing. I cannot get a tune out of my head.
SARAH,Well there is so much room for it.
ANNE,Lady Marlborough. You are such a wit.
ANNE,You are a dear Abigail. I shall retire for the evening.
SARAH,Shall I prepare your bed Queen Anne?
SARAH,Or shall you and I adjourn to your apartments for sherry?
ANNE,A sherry sounds just the ticket.
SARAH,Good night Abigail.
ANNE,"Yes, good night dear Abigail."
ABIGAIL,You are enjoying all this aren’t you?
MASHAM,"To be beloved. Of course. To see you trying to win me. Why, what is not to love my dear?"
ABIGAIL,You will stop this ridiculous infatuation. You have made your point.
ABIGAIL,Perhaps I was not making a point.
ABIGAIL,"Perhaps because of my past, perhaps some malformation of my heart... I blame my father of course... cunt ..I must take control of my circumstance. I will need to act in a way that meets the edges of my morality. To trust is to risk, and when I end up living on the street selling my arsehole to syphilitic soldiers, steadfast morality will be a fucking nonsense that will mock me daily."
ANNE,I’m not quite following.
ABIGAIL,Shhhhh.
SARAH,I apologise. But... do shhhh when I’m thinking.
ABIGAIL,Your hair is so lustrous. It is something people in court comment on.
ANNE,Really. I always thought of it as nest like.
SARAH,I shall make you tea.
SARAH,What a lovely idea. Thank you Abigail.
ANNE,Of course.
SARAH,Pat the kids hello.
ANNE,Of course.
SARAH,You will give that speech on the tax increase in parliament next week.
ANNE,I dreamed of the man on the roadside with one eye.
SARAH,What man?
ANNE,When we drove through town. He stared at me in such a way. I felt my blood chill.
SARAH,So kind.
ANNE,Abigail. Do you think people are angry?
SARAH,Anne! She does not know.
MASHAM,We should ask people. Bring a group of people from the villages in and ask them.
SARAH,"That is not how matters of state are dealt with. People are led, they do not lead! Would you leave Marlborough exposed? He needs another battalion ready to join him. And that means money."
ABIGAIL,Do not yell at me! I am the Queen!
HARLEY,Then for once act like it!
ABIGAIL,Is the Queen to-
HARLEY,Do not speak to me.
ABIGAIL,I have thought on the terms of our friendship.
HARLEY,I thought it was unconditional love. THE FAVOURITE SHOOTING SCRIPT 6 MAR 17 68.
ABIGAIL,I will get you an audience with the Queen if you ask her a favour for me.
HARLEY,Wench. You will-
ABIGAIL,Harley you do not need me as an enemy. As it turns out I am capable of much unpleasantness.
HARLEY,As am I.
ABIGAIL,It’s so tiring to be like this!
HARLEY,"The Queen has taken a shine to me and I will drip poison into her ear regarding you, until she is mad with hatred for you. Or we will have a mutually advantageous friendship. Count of three. Yes or no?"
ABIGAIL,"If you are so close to the Queen, why not just ask this favour yourself?"
HARLEY,I do not want her to ever think I want anything from her.
ABIGAIL,And have you counselled her for our side?
HARLEY,No.
ANNE,Why not? The country’s future hangs in the balance.
HARLEY,Uh huh. My thing is what I wish to talk about.
ANNE,You do not care? I thought you were on our side.
HARLEY,"I am on my side. Always. Sometimes it is a happy coincidence for you. Like now, you will get a chance to save the country."
ANNE,What tremendous luck to find you in the garden.
HARLEY,We were taking the air.
ANNE,You do not like the war. I know that.
HARLEY,No. I do not. But we must... fight... for what we fight for.
HARLEY,"Godolphin and Lady Marlborough seem to have corralled you, so that you do not get to hear from your loyal opposition."
HARLEY,I am briefed appropriately.
ANNE,Were it in person I’d believe it.
HARLEY,I am often ill.
ANNE,True. Sadly true. The war with the French will bleed us dry even if we win. We are in our strongest position now. If Marlborough loses this next battle we could lose all.
HARLEY,The people hate the war you realise. They begin to hate you.
ANNE,Lady Marlborough has not told you of the riots in Leeds?
HARLEY,No. But there was a man with one eye that was...very distressing.
ANNE,All I ask is that you search your heart.
HARLEY,Of course.
ANNE,Not Lady Marlborough’s heart. Your own. I must also talk to you of your maid.
MASHAM,Abigail.
GODOLPHIN,"I believe that is her name. It seems Colonel Masham has fallen for her, he wishes to marry."
ANNE,But she is a maid.
GODOLPHIN,It is irregular and inexplicable but being sentimental I am moved to help if possible.
ANNE,What do you mean she has not been seen?!
SARAH,She took a horse. It did not come back and nor did she.
MAE,I shall send riders. THE FAVOURITE SHOOTING SCRIPT 6 MAR 17 71.
SARAH,I think she means to vex me. Do not send riders.
MAE,In case she has fallen though.
MAE,She is too good a rider too fall. I know what she is... Do not seek her.
ANNE,Where am I?
ANNE,You’re in heaven. That’s God. You’ll meet him later.
ANNE,I must... go.
ANNE,I don’t think that’s happening. Lie back.
GODOLPHIN,Stop infection.
ANNE,Get Lady Marlborough.
ANNE,Just take.. me to her!
GODOLPHIN,Find her!
ANNE,We must look for her! She could die out there! There are wolves out there are there not?
ANNE,No Your Majesty. I don’t think so. There are bandits and...
ABIGAIL,I think there are wolves! Find her!
GODOLPHIN,No one knows where she is?
HARLEY,No one has heard or seen of her.
ANNE,I thought she was...
HARLEY,What if she is-
GODOLPHIN,"Perhaps she has gone to Blenheim, her palace?"
HARLEY,There is no palace yet. It is the woods.
GODOLPHIN,Well we should check in the trees just to be sure.
HARLEY,Mr Harley!
ANNE,"I apologise. I hope we find her, and she is not dead in a ditch. The business of state however cannot stop. The Prime Minister has a ludicrous and costly idea to-"
GODOLPHIN,Your majesty. There has been no word from the front in two weeks. There is no doubt that Marlborough is in trouble. We need to send a division immediately to help him.
ABIGAIL,"Costing a fortune, and built on your paranoia and walking into God know what? The messengers could’ve been killed, found a whore they liked the taste of. Or it could all be done and we have lost and they walk into an ambush."
GODOLPHIN,"Your Majesty I beg of you. Immediate action is needed. Funds, men."
ABIGAIL,We need to wait.
ANNE,I... well... I will... think on it for a-
HARLEY,This cannot wait. We need to act now.
ANNE,"Is it somewhat like going late to a party. If the party’s going well, they did not need you and resent the intrusion. If it is going badly, you cannot save it, but tend to get excruciatingly bored and regret you ever put on your nice gown for it."
SARAH,It is not like a party!
KEVIN,"I’m sorry Prime Minister, a passing thought."
SARAH,I think it is like a party.
KEVIN,A perfect analogy.
KEVIN,We will wait. But they should be in their dresses ready to go at a moments notice. Shift a division to the coast and have a boat at the ready.
SARAH,Boy. Fetch me a carriage.
KEVIN,Mae says no.
MAE,I’m leaving. Help me up.
SARAH,Shut up. Or I’ll give you something to do with your mouth.
MAE,Mae says no. Mae says no.
SARAH,Why don’t you think for yourself?
MAE,I can hurt you if I have to. She said. But I get to decide if I have to. So that is thinking for myself.
SARAH,Feeling better then?
MAE,Is my horse alive or did you eat it?
SARAH,"I sold it. Still didn’t pay for your upkeep. But you look better. Don’t worry about the face, some men like that. Not many, but some."
ANNE,Thank you for your kindness but I need to leave.
ABIGAIL,"You still owe me though. You can suck for your supper from now on. I’ll take twenty percent. You seem posh, gents will like that."
ANNE,Have you ever seen ten gold sovereigns?
ABIGAIL,In my dreams.
ANNE,Go to Hyde Park fountain at nine in the morning and you’ll see a man walking a duck.
ANNE,Abigail. I worry something has befallen her. It is night. Out there alone.
ABIGAIL,She is strong. She will be fine.
ANNE,"Yes, yes, she will. She saved me my whole life. Without her I am nothing."
ABIGAIL,That is not true. You are the Queen.
ANNE,"I am tired. It hurts, everything hurts. Everyone leaves me. Dies. Finally her."
ABIGAIL,"If she is not dead, I will cut her throat. She may be trying to hurt me, make me dissolve and dissemble and... I will not!"
ANNE,Sssh. She is fine. They will find her. THE FAVOURITE SHOOTING SCRIPT 6 MAR 17 77.
ABIGAIL,I do not care. You are such a beautiful person. You glow with... loveliness. We must marry you.
ANNE,What?
ABIGAIL,Colonel Masham wishes to marry you.
ANNE,He does?
ANNE,Yes. You have captured him.
ABIGAIL,That is... absurd. I have nothing to offer. I am a penniless servant. It would be career suicide.
ANNE,Your first thought is for him? You are a darling.
MASHAM,"I care for him. Not as I care for you, but enough to marry. I will not lie, I would like to be a Lady again. I am not perfect."
ABIGAIL,Yes. Yes.
MASHAM,This is right. While she is gone. If we wait she will return and yell and stomp about it. But you must have this. It is a gift I give you and I demand you take it.
ABIGAIL,Of course. When will-
ANNE,Now! Of course it must be now!
HARLEY,"I, Samuel Masham, take thee, Abigail Hill, to be my lawful wedded wife."
ANNE,"I, Abigail Hill, take thee, Samuel Masham, to be my lawful wedded husband."
MASHAM,"With this ring I thee wed, with my body I thee worship, and with all my worldly goods I thee endow."
ABIGAIL,It is most generous. I am overwhelmed.
ANNE,Shall we say ‘gambling debts’ Mr Harley?
HARLEY,Excellent.
MASHAM,You are to take apartments on the east wing.
ABIGAIL,Thank you Your Majesty.
MASHAM,Thank you! Thank you!
ABIGAIL,It is fun to be Queen sometimes.
MASHAM,One can only imagine.
ABIGAIL,You’re looking the wrong way.
MASHAM,Where could she have gone? You rode through the forest looking for her?
ABIGAIL,I have told you before.
ABIGAIL,"She would be sick, for several days, but she would be near recovered by now."
ABIGAIL,She probably went back to Southampton.
GODOLPHIN,"To do what? To plan what? To get ready, to-"
SARAH,I am as hard as a rock and it is our wedding night!
GODOLPHIN,Lie still.
SARAH,"Now she is gone I find myself more concerned than when she was here. For it is like she could strike from anywhere at anytime, and I will not see it coming."
GODOLPHIN,"Sssh. I must be calm. She is gone, I am married. But I must be ready and yet how to be ready when one does not see the enemy. My life is a maze I continually think I have found a way out of, only to find another corner in front of me."
SARAH,"What happened, are you alright?"
GODOLPHIN,"That cunt Abigail poisoned me, Mary Magdalene found me."
SARAH,Did they rape you?
SARAH,"No they didn’t, but gainful employment is on offer should I need it."
SARAH,Abigail did this?
SARAH,Yes. How goes the Kingdom?
ABIGAIL,The Queen is considering a peace treaty offer to the French. And to switch two positions in cabinet to them. Harley suddenly has her ear.
SARAH,Had. Had her ear. Take me home.
ABIGAIL,Ladies.
SARAH,"Well, I could always silence a room."
SARAH,"Oh dear, the servant is dressed in the clothes of a Lady. How whimsical. Is it a game of some sort?"
ABIGAIL,"Lady Sarah, my dear friend and cousin, how good to see you have returned from...?"
ABIGAIL,Hell. I’m sure you will pass through it sometime.
SARAH,You have missed a few things. My marriage. It was a simple affair but beautifully done.
ANNE,Everyone leave.
SARAH,"If you offer me tea, you’ll forgive me if I shan’t accept."
ANNE,"I searched my heart and I did not have trust in it and that is my shame. I could not just stand by and let you destroy me. You maybe taught me that. But it is over now. I have won, I am safe. We do not need to fight anymore. Is that not grand? If you just forgive me, we can be happy together."
SARAH,Obviously you have some anger to expiate. I will allow it this once.
ANNE,Congratulations on your wedded bliss.
SARAH,Your face.
ANNE,"Do I look that bad? If I was a man it would seem quite dashing, a scar like this."
SARAH,Where have you been Sarah? Why did you leave like that?
ANNE,"I went riding, some bandits attacked me, it took me a while to fight them off."
SARAH,Your poor face.
SARAH,You should see them. And you have been well I trust? Well taken care of. Men were eventually sent to find me I hear.
ANNE,I worried for you. I... thought you were... You did not do it to hurt me?
SARAH,I do not play games with you.
ANNE,I know. I know.
SARAH,"Look at me. I will say this plainly and once my dearest one, you must send Abigail away."
FOOTMAN O/S,From my heart Mrs Morley. Do it.
SARAH,I do not want to.
SARAH,She is a viper.
HARLEY,"You are jealous, it is very sweet. You always said I needed too much love from you. Now with you both I have enough. Please accept that. Love her as me. You have been rather mean to her, I would also like that to change."
SARAH,You will do as I tell you.
GODOLPHIN,The Prime Minister and Mr Harley!
SARAH,Not -
HARLEY,What is it!?
ANNE,A thousand pardons your Majesty. But word from the front.
SARAH,What has happened?
GODOLPHIN,"Marlborough is ready, he has them outflanked. He needs a garrison to attack the coast."
ANNE,We must prepare quickly.
SARAH,The Queen has already readied a garrison.
ANNE,Let them go to the party now.
HARLEY,What...party?
SARAH,Of course your majesty.
ANNE,"It happened while you were gone. Thank you gentleman, keep me informed of all progress."
SARAH,You may leave. I would like to speak to the Queen alone.
ANNE,Yes. Leave us.
SARAH,It is good to see you home and looking so well Lady Marlborough.
ANNE,"Now, You did very well with the divisions."
SARAH,I know I did.
ANNE,However the two new Cabinet positions they must stay with the whigs.
ANNE,I am the Queen. Do not try to... do that thing you do.
ANNE,Do not try to manage this as you cannot. I know Harley has been in your ear and Abigail in your -
SARAH,Enough! You must be as I wish you to be now. Do you understand?
SARAH,Anne
ANNE,Don’t.
SARAH,Your face frightens me. Don’t.
ANNE,Good night Lady Marlborough.
SARAH,You do not do this! You do not!
SARAH,Morning.
ANNE,Morning.
SARAH,I think I’m becoming quite sentimental as I get older.
ANNE,I don’t think you have the capacity for sentimentality.
SARAH,"I didn’t think so either, but so much is surprising me lately. I started looking over some of the many, many, many letters you’ve written to me."
ANNE,"‘I long for your embrace’, ‘I long for the heat from your naked body on mine.’ Very intense. Very... explicit."
SARAH,What are you-
ANNE,I thought I’d misplaced some of them the other day. Quite a fright. What if say that son of a bitch Jonathan Swift got them? In his newspaper the next day? You would be ruined.
ABIGAIL,You would never.
COURTIER,You have no idea what I would do for my country. And for you.
SARAH,Ruin me? You would do that?
COURTIER,"I will use these letters unless you announce the tax rise, change the Cabinet as I wish, and get rid of Abigail."
SARAH,Do you not wish to know what I have decided?
SARAH,I wish to know you are happy and that your spirit will lighten once this is done.
SARAH,The Queen requests the return of your key. You will return it and vacate Court today.
SARAH,Where is she?
ANNE,You are to hand over the key. The Queen will not grant you an audience.
SARAH,Anne! I handed over my key.
ANNE,You are angry I know. I am sorry. I went quite mad for a moment. Just open the door.
SARAH,I burnt the letters. I burnt them. Do what you will.
ANNE,I will not come back. Do you understand! I will go and be gone! Abigail has done this. She does not love you!
SARAH,Because how could anyone? She wants nothing from me! Unlike you.
ANNE,"She wants nothing from you, and yet somehow she is a Lady with two thousand a year, and Harley sits on your knee most nights."
ANNE,I wish you would love me as she does.
ABIGAIL,You wish me to lie to you?! ‘Oh you look like an angel that fell from heaven your Majesty’. No! Some days you look like a badger. And you can rely on me to tell you.
ABIGAIL,Why?!
SARAH,Because I will not lie! That is love!
ABIGAIL,I must go attend to my duties.
SARAH,"I have. I have over the last several months been unhappy with the government. Lord Godolphin has lost my confidence. Therefore I am announcing the new Prime Minister will be Mr. Harley. Godolphin, I thank you for your service. We will sue for peace with France immediately. I have spoken. All depart."
ABIGAIL,Leave that. I like it.
DRIVER,I am moving in. The rug stays too.
SARAH,Oh my God. You actually think you have won.
ABIGAIL,Haven’t I?
ABIGAIL,We were playing very different games.
ANNE,"Well, all I know is, your carriage awaits and my maid’s on her way up with something called a pineapple."
ABIGAIL,Go?
ANNE,Go.
ABIGAIL,Do it again!
ANNE,Ow... I am here.
ANNE,Do my legs please.
ABIGAIL,Of course.
ABIGAIL,Hot towels now!
ANNE,Are you drunk?
ABIGAIL,I have had wine. Very good wine. I could get you some. It would ease you.
GODOLPHIN,No.
SARAH,I do not understand these... papers.
GODOLPHIN,I am feeling unwell. Excuse me a moment.
SARAH,Sorry. I am unwell.
GODOLPHIN,Lay down and I will fetch the doctor my love.
SARAH,Thank you.
GODOLPHIN,How is early retirement?
SARAH,Dull. What goes on?
GODOLPHIN,"They have brokered a peace with the French, giving up too much of course."
SARAH,Of course.
GODOLPHIN,Marlborough returns in a week.
GODOLPHIN,Harley will move to have him replaced.
GODOLPHIN,"...I hadn’t seen it, but of course."
SARAH,I will rip his mole from his face. You must stop it Godolphin.
GODOLPHIN,I only have so much sway without you there.
SARAH,"I will tell you how, and you must use my words."
GODOLPHIN,It would be easier to pull my strings if you were back at court.
SARAH,Obviously you have chosen to keep the particulars of your dismissal from me. I shall leave a gap in the conversation for you to remedy that.
GODOLPHIN,I do not know of women and their feelings. But I know they nurse their hurts like wailing newborns.
HARLEY,"Godolphin, I feel a surge of desire to see your nose broken. Your point?"
HARLEY,A letter. An apology of some sort that facilitates your return.
GODOLPHIN,There are limits to what one can give.
HARLEY,You once told me quite the opposite.
GODOLPHIN,How is Anne? Happy?
HARLEY,She seems...as mercurial as ever. Her health suffers however.
GODOLPHIN,Now that the peace with France has been made-
ANNE,Marlborough’s return back to England is imminent. I wonder Your Majesty whether it is right that he is left as head of our forces?
GODOLPHIN,He is a hero who won the peace for us!
HARLEY,Indeed. But he would have launched us into a bloody war that would have ruined us. So there’s that.
ANNE,We have made a poor peace that we will rue.
GODOLPHIN,"Well, our people are happy. I suggest, Queen Anne, that as a gesture of our graciousness to France perhaps he should be stood aside? A new era of peace and prosperity, a new day, a door to a new future, metaphors abound."
ANNE,It will look like we surrendered and the palace will be surrounded with men who lost eyes and arms in the war angry at this slight on their leader.
GODOLPHIN,Men with...
ANNE,They will stare in at us with rage.
GODOLPHIN,What a preposterous idea Godolphin. What are you-
ANNE,I...a...am tired...I will ponder it. Thank you all.
GODOLPHIN,"Your Majesty, may I broach the matter of Lady Marlborough?"
GODOLPHIN,No. You may not.
ANNE,"A breach in a dear friendship, surely this could be healed?"
ABIGAIL,Some wounds will not close. I have many such. One just walks around with them. Sometimes one can feel them filling with blood.
HARLEY,Quite. Lady Marlborough is a woman of passion. Perhaps she behaved rashly and is apologetic for her behaviors?
ABIGAIL,You know this?
ABIGAIL,I... believe it to be so.
HARLEY,Her love and loyalty to you and this country are her reasons for living. Perhaps she could write you and we could attempt to repair at least one wound in our Queen?
ABIGAIL,I cannot stop her. I would imagine it is pointless and I would dash the letter into the fire. But... I cannot stop her.
HARLEY,Shut up please. SHUT UP!
ABIGAIL,A moment.
HARLEY,We will reconvene with some order and grace after lunch.
ANNE,I cannot control them. Whining for more.
ABIGAIL,Marlborough will return soon. THE FAVOURITE SHOOTING SCRIPT 6 MAR 17 96.
ANNE,"What is that to me? Your politics is dreary Harley. I have what I want, you have what you want. Our business is done."
ABIGAIL,If Marlborough remains head of our forces she has every right to be at court. Even if she is at odds with the Queen.
ABIGAIL,I see.
ANNE,I imagined you would. The Queen and her must not have the opportunity to repair this wedge between them. For if they do I pity what Lady Marlborough will make of you. If there was some gentle nudge you might provide to the Queen’s cogitations on this issue.
ABIGAIL,Are you sure this is all the mail?
ANNE,You seek something?
ABIGAIL,No. A...fabric piece from my cousin in Florence.
ANNE,I’m sure it will come.
ABIGAIL,Everyone is on the bed. Shall I join?
ANNE,Of course.
ABIGAIL,I am in a quandary and you are my dearest one. I do not know whether to speak of...
ANNE,What is it?
ABIGAIL,I will... I am not sure.
ANNE,"I do not like this, you will lodge this unknowable thing in my brain and it will eat me with horrible possibilities."
ABIGAIL,It is not horrible dear Anne. It is just money.
ANNE,Money?
ABIGAIL,"I have found in the books, large amounts of money that seem to have flowed to Marlborough. But is not reflected in the forces receipts of expenses. THE FAVOURITE SHOOTING SCRIPT 6 MAR 17 98."
ANNE,What?
ABIGAIL,It is gone. I did not know who’s attention to bring it to. Shall I request it back on his return? Quietly perhaps?
ANNE,You are saying Sarah diverted money to him?
ANNE,It does seem so. Some seven thousand.
ABIGAIL,She would not.
SALLY,It is just-
ABIGAIL,She would not!
ANNE,"I am of course, perhaps mistaken in the bookkeeping. Sometimes all these numbers are dizzying. And they often do add up on second or third attempt. They are as fickle as humans. A simple explanation I am not seeing. We shall banish it from our minds. We should take the children for a walk in the garden?"
FOOTMAN,No. Thank you. I need to rest.
ANNE,You may go.
ABIGAIL,Fuck!
ANNE,I need to put it back.
ABIGAIL,Be gone.
ABIGAIL,This cannot be all of it!

ABIGAIL,Anne.
ANNE,Darling Anne. Let’s get you in a chair.
ANNE,How dare you touch the Queen like that.
