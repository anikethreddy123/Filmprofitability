PEPE,I can’t.
PEPE,Mom!
CLEO,Of course you can! Come on! Let’s go!
PEPE,I said I can’t!
CLEO,"If I went to bed every time I thought “I can’t”, I would live in bed!"

CLEO,Nothing! He just called to say hi!
ADELA,"Sure... Now you’ve stolen my boyfriend, right?"
CLEO,"What? You crazy? Fermín is only my friend. Plus, you’re the one who introduced us."
ADELA,"Ay, manita! Look at you! I’m just messing with you. I only went out twice with him and didn’t even let him kiss me."
CLEO,They’re here...
PACO,A friend told me that a kid in his cousin’s school was killed by a soldier because he threw a water balloon at him.
TOÑO,Says who?
PACO,"Says Flores. If you don’t believe me, ask him. He says he was in Chapultepec, near the new one, and that he was with his brother, throwing water balloons down at the passing cars and so an army Jeep passed and they threw one and the soldier got off and shot him."
CLEO,Jesus! And what happened to him?
PACO,"What do you mean, what happened? He got shot in the head, he’s dead."
CLEO,Horrible!
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"Hello children, what are you eating?"
SOFI AND PEPE,Mom!

TOÑO,I guess so.
CLEO,"Ándali, the señora is here. Sofía and Toño want their strawberries..."
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"Cleo, could you please send the señor’s two suits to the dry cleaners. It has to be today because he’s leaving on Friday and has to pack them."
CLEO,"Don’t worry, ma’am, I’ll take them."

PACO,"How come you don’t know, silly?"
SOFI,I don’t. So what?
TOÑO,It’s in Canada.
PACO,Is he flying Eastern?
SEÑORA SOFÍA,I don’t know. I think it’s Panam.
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"No sugar for Sofi, or she’ll get fat."
CLEO,You know you can’t come up here.
PACO,I looked after him the whole way up.
CLEO,Your mom is going to be angry.
PACO,"I’m going to come out of here and you come over here, and when I get to here you’ll shoot me, but I’ll shoot you first and you’ll fall dead... Like this... with your arms wide open..."
CLEO,Just don’t play next to the edge.
PACO,C’mon...
PACO,You were supposed to die!
PEPE,Why aren’t you the one who dies?
PACO,Cause it’s my game.
PEPE,Then I don’t wanna play anymore.
PACO,"Well, then I don’t want you to play, sissy."
CLEO,What happened to you?
PEPE,I’m dead.
CLEO,"Well, let’s go down then."
PEPE,I can’t. I’m dead.
CLEO,"Then come back to life, we have to go down!"
PEPE,"If you die, you can’t live again."

CLEO,And why would I die?
PEPE,I’m just saying... Heaven or hell?
CLEO,You’re killing me all the time...
PEPE,"Well, it’s a game! Tell me already... heaven or hell?"

CLEO,Sli-ding...?
SOFI,Slide show.
PEPE,That thing. About hell.
CLEO,Hell?
PEPE,"Yep, paintings and photos...."
CLEO,Photos?
PEPE,"Yeah. He said there was fire on all sides... and that while they burn you, there’s some real ugly devils poking you, like this, with irons... and others that bite you or eat your arms...."
CLEO,Ay chicú! horrible! Stop talking about that...!
PEPE,Yeah but it doesn’t matter...!
CLEO,What do you mean it doesn’t matter? What about all the fire?
PEPE,He says it doesn’t matter cause that’s where he wants to go!
CLEO,What? But didn’t you say they burn people there?
PEPE,"Yes, but Paco says everyone there is naked!"

ADELA,Aaaaaaayyyyyyy...!
CLEO,That he felt so alone without me...
ADELA,Poor guy!
CLEO,That he couldn’t take not seeing me no more...
ADELA,Aaaaaaay...
CLEO,"And so my cousin, he comes over from the village to run some errands and brings me another letter from Moisés..."
ADELA,And?
CLEO,"And so he pulls out the letter and gives it to me... But the letter was there with a bunch of other letters, and as he’s pulling it out, they all spill onto the floor. And so I see one with Moisés’s handwriting, and so I just take it and I open it...!"
ADELA,"And sure enough, it was Moisés’s. I can’t stop thinking about you... I want to see you.... I feel so alone without you... I miss you so..."

FERMÍN,When I was a kid and my ma died...
FERMÍN,"My aunt took me in... Over there in Neza. And between my cousins who beat me up and the bad influences, I started drinking...and then huffing...I was dying..."
FERMÍN,"But then I found out about martial arts. And so then those things... well, you know, suddenly everything seemed, well... focused?"

TOÑO,When’s dad coming?
SEÑORA SOFÍA,That’s the other thing I wanted to talk to you about. His research is delayed and he’ll have to stay in Quebec a little longer.
TOÑO,Will he be back by January?
SEÑORA SOFÍA,He doesn’t know. But that’s why I brought you the paper. So you can each write him a letter.
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"Tell him how much you miss him, to come back soon please..."
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"Pepe, you draw him somthing..."

SEÑORA SOFÍA,Is your mother all right?
CLEO,It’s just that... Señora Sofi...
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Yes?
CLEO,It’s just that... I think I’m expecting.
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"What do you mean, you think?"
CLEO,It’s just that I haven’t gotten my period.
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Since when?
CLEO,I don’t know...
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"Oh you silly, silly girl. And who is the dad?"
CLEO,Fermín. Adela’s boyfriend’s cousin.
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Does he know?
CLEO,He’s disappeared.
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"Silly, silly, silly...!"
CLEO,"You’re going to fire me, aren’t you?"
SEÑORA SOFÍA,What do you mean fire you? We have to take you to the doctor to get checked.
PEPE,"Look, ma. I drew a plane."
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Very good. Now put some hearts on it...
SOFI,Sofi! I told you to help your brother write “I miss you.”
PEPE,He won’t let me help him!
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Why is Cleo crying?
PEPE,"For no reason. She’s got a stomachache. Let’s see, come over here. Let’s write your letter."
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"Sana, sana colita de rana. Si no sanas hoy, sanarás mañana..."

NURSE,"Good day, I have an appointment with Doctor Vélez."
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Under what name?
SEÑORA SOFÍA,It’s Doctor Roldán’s wife.
DOCTORA VÉLEZ,"Hello, Margarita. Thank you for seeing us."
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"Of course, Sofía. With pleasure."
DOCTORA VÉLEZ,Remember Cleo?
CLEO,"Of course! Hi Cleo, how are you?"
DOCTORA VÉLEZ,"Fine, thank you, doctor."
DOCTORA VÉLEZ,"So, let’s see how you’re doing, Cleo."
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"Come with me and tell me all about it... Sofía, you want to come as well?"
DOCTORA VÉLEZ,"Thank you, Margarita. I’ll just go over to say hi to Doctor Zavala."
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"Well, Cleo and I are going to have a chat. Why don’t we meet in the lobby in forty minutes or so?"
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Sure. I’ll be back then.
DOCTORA VÉLEZ,"Go on Cleo, go with the doctor."
CLEO,"All right then. Cleo, tell me."
DOCTORA VÉLEZ,It’s just that.... That...
CLEO,"It’s OK Cleo, you can talk to me..."
DOCTORA VÉLEZ,It’s that I haven’t gotten my period.
CLEO,Since when?
DOCTORA VÉLEZ,About two months maybe?
DOCTORA VÉLEZ,OK. And you’ve been sexually active for how long?
CLEO,Have you had many partners?
DOCTORA VÉLEZ,Oh no! Never!
DOCTORA VÉLEZ,Do you use protection?
DOCTORA VÉLEZ,Do you use condoms?
CLEO,When was the last time you got checked?
DOCTORA VÉLEZ,Probably three or four years ago when I came to see you.
CLEO,"That’s not good, Cleo. You have to get checked twice a year."
DOCTORA VÉLEZ,"Yes, doctor."
DOCTORA VÉLEZ,"Well, let’s see how you’re doing. This is going to feel a little cold..."
DOCTOR ZAVALA,"Hi, Mario..."
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Doctoress...
DOCTORA VÉLEZ,How’s Cleo doing?
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Cleo is ten weeks pregnant. She’s very healthy and very strong and so is her baby. One thing: she has to get an iron shot every two weeks. I’ve given her a prescription.
DOCTORA VÉLEZ,When’s she due?
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Sometime around the end of June.
DOCTORA VÉLEZ,"Oh Margarita, thank you so much for seeing her."
DOCTORA VÉLEZ,"It’s nothing! I missed her, right Cleo? OK, I’m off..."
CLEO,"Bye, Cleo. See you next month for your check up."
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"Yes, doctor. Thank you."
PEPE,"Cleo, why don’t you go down to the third floor to see the new-born babies while I finish up here with Doctor Zavala?"
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Why does the mountain spell LEA?
TOÑO,So that you kids read. See? Even the mountain is asking.
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"It’s the initials for Luis Echeverría Álvarez, dummy."
TOÑO,Don’t call him that. He’s 5. He doesn’t have to know who Echeverría is. Explain it to him.
SOFI,He’s the president!
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Isn’t it Gustavo Díaz Ordaz?
SOFI,"Not anymore, Sofi. It’s now Luis Echeverría, since December 1st."
PACO,Oooooh...
CLEO,Cleo really likes Echeverría. Yuck!
TOÑO,"Well, yeah. His wife Doña Ester is always dressed in huipiles and Oaxacan clothing. He likes us Indians."
CLEO,But my uncle Alberto says he’s the one who ordered the students killed two years ago.
TOÑO,Noooooo!
SOFI,He was the Minister of the Interior.
TOÑO,Why did he kill the students?
SEÑORA SOFÍA,‘Cause they didn’t do their homework.
PEPE,"Enough, Toño. No, Sofi, Toño is just messing with you."
MOLLY,Well I don’t like him. Why does he write on the mountain? It’s not his!
BENITA,Comadre!
CLEO,You sure you can carry that?
BENITA,"Yes, I’m with child, not sick. What? You tired already?"
CLEO,As if!
BENITA,I haven’t seen you for six months and you got old on me.
BENITA,Where you going?
BENITA,You’ve gone too far. What? Since you’re pregnant you forget everything?
BENITA,Señor José had the room redecorated. They’re the Hacienda dogs. Look... They were all in storage.
CLEO,"Look, that there is Pirata. He lived here in 1911."
BENITA,Pirata...
CLEO,And do you remember Canela?
BENITA,"Yeah, where’s she at?"
CLEO,Look at her.
BENITA,Yikes!
CLEO,She died during the summer.
CLEO,They say she must have eaten a poisoned rat. But I think it was the villagers who are bothering Don José again about the land...
LUPE,"I saw you, Paco! Get out of here!"
DR. JOSÉ DE LA BÁRCENA,Rodri! Don’t run in the water! You’re soaking wet!
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"Celso, do you still have bullets or should I send Lupe to get the ones in the chest?"
MOLLY,"Don’t run over there, you could get shot!"
CLEO,"Boys! Vayase! Andy, get back!"
DR. ALEJANDRO MATOS,"Wait, Pepe. Where are you going?"
MOLLY,What? Don’t ladies shoot?
DR. ALEJANDRO MATOS,Leslie is our representative!
CLAUDIA,"Leslie doesn’t count, she’s a gringa."
SAMANTHA,Coming!
DR. ALEJANDRO MATOS,"Yes, Claudia. You show them, girl!"
LESLIE,"Leslie, could you help Claudia?"
LESLIE,Come. Point the gun to the floor when you’re not using it.
CLAUDIA,"C’mon, Lola. You really have to wear a miniskirt and platform shoes? We’re in the woods."
DR. JOSÉ DE LA BÁRCENA,"Forget her. You look great, Lola."
LOLA,"Let’s see Lola, you want to shoot?"
DR. JOSÉ DE LA BÁRCENA,Sure.
DR. ALEJANDRO MATOS,Don’t close your eyes when you shoot...
RICARDO EDWARDS,Can you pour me a whisky with two ice cubes?
SAMANTHA,"Be careful Pepe, your wife is like a guerrilla fighter!"
RICARDO EDWARDS,"Come on, comadre!"
BENITA,"Co-ra-zón de melón, de melón melón! Corazón!"
BENITA,Come her for a sec.
CLEO,Just come over for a sec.
BENITA,But... what if?
RICARDO EDWARDS,What? Is a kid going to cry because he lost at marbles or his brother stepped on him?
GLORIA,"Co-ra-zón de me-lón, de me-lón, me-lón, co-ra-zón!"
BENITA,What? They finally let you out?
CLEO,What’ll you have?
BENITA,"Nothing, thank you."
CLEO,"What? You’re not going to toast the New Year with us? What, you only speak English now?"
BENITA,It’s just that... the baby...
BENITA,A drink on New Year’s will do it good. Celebrate while you can. See that guy with the hat?
BENITA,They killed his son in August. The villagers did. Because of a land dispute.
CLEO,You got life?
BENITA,Sure...
CLEO,I mean liquor.
BENITA,I’d rather just have a little pulque.
BENITA,That’s the spirit!
CLEO AND BENITA,Here’s to a beautiful 1971 and to your baby’s health!
GLORIA,Cheers!
BENITA,"Sorry, manita!"
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"No sweat. You dance, we got plenty more where that came from!"
DR. ALEJANDRO MATOS,What are you doing?
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"Come, now... You know you want to..."
DR. ALEJANDRO MATOS,"No, Alex! Leave me alone! You’re drunk!"
DR. ALEJANDRO MATOS,"Fine. Fine! I just wanted to comfort you, but..."
SCREAMING,"It’s not even like you’re that hot, comadre..."

PACO,Don’t run too far. We’ll just reach to the outskirts and come back!
BENITA,What skirts?
PACO,The hillside.
BENITA,You mean the hill has skirts?
PACO,"The outskirts... well, the slopes then!"
PACO,"Alex, the hill has a skirt!"
CLAUDIA,If we lean over we’ll be able to see its panties.
PACO,What are you guys doing?
LOLA,Looking up the hill’s skirts to see its panties.
PACO,Hills don’t have underwear.
LOLA,And neither do you!
PACO,Asshole!
GLORIA,Ooooooh!
CLEO,Alex! Paco! Leave the girls alone!
CLEO,"It’s like my village. Without the mountain, of course, but it looks just like this..."
CLEO,This is how it sounds...
CLEO,Just like this...
PACO,This is how it smells...
TOÑO,"Look, they fixed it all up. Just like new, right?"
BETO,The Cowboys won only because Baltimore was overconfident.
TOÑO,What are you talking about? We scored three touchdowns in the second half. One after the other!
SOFI,I’m telling you. Baltimore was overconfident. How can you root for the Cowboys?
PACO,I like the Cowboy’s cheerleaders. In my school...
TOÑO,Who cares about cheerleaders?
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Ma? Can Beto and I go to the movies?
TOÑO,What are you going to see?
PACO,"The Red Tent, at The Americas theater."
TOÑO,I want to go too!
PACO,"No, just Beto and me."
TOÑO,How come?
SOFI,Get yourself your own friends!
TOÑO,I want to go to the movies too!
SEÑORA SOFÍA,I said no! It’s just me and Beto.
TOÑO,Either everyone goes or no one goes!
PACO,They can go to a different movie!
TOÑO,I want to go to Las Americas!
SEÑORA SOFÍA,You don’t even know what The Red Tent is!
TOÑO,"I said, either everyone goes or no one goes!"
SEÑORA SOFÍA,It’s not fair!
PEPE,If you don’t like it you can go live somewhere else!
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Is it a cartoon?
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"Hello? Oh, yes, hold on a minute..."
SEÑORA SOFÍA (O.S.),"Cleo! I’m going to get this upstairs, would you mind hanging up here!"
MOLLY (V.O.),There...!
SEÑORA TERESA,"How are you feeling, comadre?"
PACO,We’re late! You coming down or what?
SEÑORA TERESA,Let them stay. Let’s go...
TOÑO,We’re leaving!
PACO,What are you waiting for?
TOÑO,...Braniff planes may be different colors but they’re all 727s...
SEÑORA TERESA,See you at the movies!
OLDER COUPLE,Toño!
YOUNG MAN,So rude...!
CLEO,It’s Zovek.
YOUNG MAN,No...! Zovek?
CLEO,Look at ‘im...
YOUNG MAN,Is that really professor Zovek?
CLEO,He’s done over a hundred push ups by now!
YOUNG MAN,What? Does he always come here?
PROFESSOR ZOVEK,"No, not always, but sometimes he comes to train them."
PROFESSOR ZOVEK,You too can be a Kombateka! Every human being holds great potential he must develop through physical conditioning and through mental and spiritual evolution.
PROFESSOR ZOVEK,"You too can develop your potential. But don’t expect any miracles, the only miracle lies in your own will."
PROFESSOR ZOVEK,This is why mental development is the true motor of physical development.
SMALL AUDIENCE,And next up... an act!
PROFESSOR ZOVEK,Ooooooh!
PROFESSOR ZOVEK,This is a routine that requires absolute physical condition! Only martial arts masters and a few great athletes can master it!
PROFESSOR ZOVEK,Yes... You... please bandage my eyes.
PROFESSOR ZOVEK,Make sure they’re totally covered. You’ve got plenty of bandage there.
PROFESSOR ZOVEK,"Thank you, you may return to your place."
PROFESSOR ZOVEK,And now...!
PROFESSOR ZOVEK,Huuuuuuuh!
PROFESSOR ZOVEK,Are you disappointed? Were you expecting me to lift a jet or an elephant?
PROFESSOR ZOVEK,You are witnessing an incredible feat! You don’t believe me? Try it.
PROFESSOR ZOVEK,Just close your eyes and lift up a foot.
PROFESSOR ZOVEK,You don’t have to lift your leg to a forty-five degree angle like me or put your arms up. Just close your eyes and lift a foot.
CLEO,True mental preparation is the path to physical realization.
FERMÍN,Fermín!
CLEO,What’s up my Cleo?
GROUP,Can you talk for a minute?
FERMÍN,Wooooooooooooo!
CLEO,"Long time no see, Cleo!"
FERMÍN,"Hi, Fermín..."
CLEO,What are you doing around these parts?
FERMÍN,"Well, I have left you so many messages and I’ve been looking for you but I can never find you so..."
CLEO,"I’m sorry my Cleo, but the training got real hard core and they even brought in a gringo trainer and another one from Korea. Well, the American had been here already, but the Korean one is new."
FERMÍN,Is it for the Olympics?
CLEO,Something like that. Who told you I was here?
FERMÍN,It’s just that a neighbor’s brother in law trains with you so...
CLEO,"It was Ramón, right?"
FERMÍN,"No, no, no!"
FERMÍN,Son of a... Fucking Ramón. I’ll get him when I see him -
CLEO,Jodan Tsuki!... Chudan Tsuki!... Mae Geri!...
FERMÍN,It’s just that... I’m with child...
CLEO,What’s it to me?
FERMÍN,"Well, the little one’s yours."
CLEO,No fucking way!
FERMÍN,"But it is, Fermín!"
FERMÍN,"I told you already, there’s no fucking way! So if you don’t want me to fuck you up real bad, you and your “little one” too, don’t ever fucking say it again and don’t ever come looking for me again!"
OLD MAN WITH ORANGES,Fucking cunt!
CLEO,...20.
SEÑORA SOFÍA (O.C.),Borras!
SEÑORA SOFÍA (O.C.),...he wrote them letters from so-called Vancouver...
CLEO,...he doesn’t even have enough of a pair to tell the children...
SEÑORA SOFÍA,G-e-t o-u-t- o-f h-e-r-e
SEÑORA SOFÍA,And you? What are you spying on?...
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"I’m sorry, I’m sorry, Paco! Why were you eavesdropping? Why were you eavesdropping?"
SEÑORA SOFÍA,And you! Why did you let him?
SOFI,Don’t say anything to your brothers and sisters. Don’t say a thing. Promise me... Promise...
SOFI,"It has so many drawings. Look, I think this little girl is me and I think this is my daddy..."
CLEO,"And this is a heart, look, with an S for Sofi and a P for Papa... and this here is a dog... or is it a fish?"
SOFI,"Maybe it’s a dolphin, I think?"
PEPE,A dolphin? No. It’s like a doggie...
SOFI,"It’s a seal! In the fourth letter my dad sent Paco, he said he can see the ocean from his hotel room and that there are a lot of seals."
PEPE,Yes. It’s a seal! Like the ones in his hotel!
CLEO,You had said dolphin. It looks nothing like a dolphin!
SOFI,No?
CLEO,No!
SOFI AND PEPE,So it’s not a dolphin? What do you think it is?
CLEO,A seal!
PEPE,What you looking at?
CLEO,When’s your baby coming out?
SOFI,Next month.
CLEO,It is a girl?
SOFI,I don’t know...
CLEO,"Oh, please let it be a girl! Pleeeease! What’s her name?"
SOFI,I don’t know.
CLEO,If it’s a girl can her name be Tabitha like Bewitched?
PEPE,Maybe...
SOFI,And will she live here?
CLEO,If she’s a girl yes!
PEPE,I don’t know. Would you like her to live here?
CLEO,No way! Yuck!
SEÑORA TERESA (O.C.),Let’s see! Put your pajamas on!
SOFI,"Children! Stop it, Toño! Stop!"
SEÑORA TERESA,Cleo! Toño and Paco are fighting!
CLEO,Stop it! Now!
SEÑORA TERESA,Boys!
CLEO,Toño!
SEÑORA TERESA,Boys! I’m going to tell your mom when she comes back!
SEÑORA TERESA,Paco!
PACO,What are you doing! Paco!
TOÑO,He hit me first!
SEÑORA TERESA,Because you pushed me!
SEÑORA TERESA,How could you throw that thing!? You could have killed your brother!
ADELA,You could have killed him!
ADELA,"You head up, manita, I’ll finish up here..."
SEÑORA SOFÍA,I’ll go.
IGNACIO,We’re alone. Always. Even though they say we aren’t.
SEÑORA TERESA,"Maybe if we park over here, far away, because there’s a student protest."
SEÑORA TERESA,I hope they don’t get them again...
CLEO,You like that one?
SEÑORA TERESA,It’s so beautiful.
SEÑORA TERESA,What’s your best price on this crib.
SALESWOMAN,"With my faithful old time customer discount, eh?"
MANAGER,Let me ask the manager.
CLEO,Put him in the closet.
IGNACIO,Aaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhggggg!
IGNACIO,Wait for me here. Just a sec.
NURSE,Excuse me...
CLEO,Line is over there...
IGNACIO,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhaa!
IGNACIO,Doctor Vélez! Doctor Vélez!
DOCTOR VÉLEZ,Doctor Vélez! Doctor Vélez!
DOCTOR VÉLEZ,"Here, here, here...."
DOCTORA VÉLEZ,Nurse! Nurse!
DOCTORA VÉLEZ,"Hi, Cleo. How are you feeling?"
SEÑOR ANTONIO,I’ll take it from here. You can wait out there.
CLEO,"Hi Cleo, how are you feeling?"
SEÑOR ANTONIO,Doctor...!
DOCTOR VÉLEZ,"You’re in good hands... How many babies have you delivered, Doctor Vélez?"
CLEO,Hundreds!
SEÑOR ANTONIO,Aaaahhhhggg!
SEÑOR ANTONIO,Breathe Cleo... Like this...
DOCTOR VÉLEZ,Doctor Vélez will only let me come up to this point....
SEÑOR ANTONIO,Don’t mind me. Come in if you like.
SEÑOR ANTONIO,"No, uh... I have a patient..."
DOCTOR VÉLEZ,"You’re going to be just fine, Cleo..."
DOCTOR VÉLEZ,"Take off all your clothes and put on this gown, OK?"
CLEO,When did you last menstruate?
DOCTOR VÉLEZ,September?
CLEO,Do you have a due date?
DOCTOR VÉLEZ,June 21st...
DOCTOR VÉLEZ,Were there any complications during the pregnancy?
CLEO,How long ago did your water break?
DOCTOR VÉLEZ,About an hour and a half ago. We couldn’t get out of where we were and...
CLEO,Was it clear?
DOCTOR VÉLEZ,Huh?
CLEO,The water. Was it transparent?
DOCTORA VÉLEZ,No. A little thick. Like soup.
DOCTOR VÉLEZ,"Don’t push Cleo, blow. Help her get on the bed..."
RESIDENT,Check dilation.
DOCTOR VÉLEZ,Seven or eight centimeters...
RESIDENT,Frequency?
NURSE,I can’t hear the foetal focus...
RESIDENT,"Blow, ma’am!"
DOCTOR VÉLEZ,She’s full. She’s in second plane... expulsive with full dilation and there is four cross meconium and asystole.
RESIDENT,"Plug in mixed solution at 5% and wheel her into Labor immediately. Alert pediatrics. Prepare a laryngoscope, reanimation equipment and an ambu."
DOCTOR VÉLEZ,Can you climb onto the gurney for me?
INTERN,Let’s get your baby out.
CLEO,Rubén Leñero’s colleague is telling me that they’ve hospitalized injured students and some Halcones came in to kill them off inside the very hospital.
DOCTOR VÉLEZ,Aaaaaaaahhhhhh!
DOCTOR VÉLEZ,"Don’t blow, Cleo. Push!"
CLEO,Almost there... Push!
CLEO,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
PEDIATRICIAN,Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhh!
PEDIATRICIAN,No heart beat. We’ll try reanimation.
PEDIATRICIAN,Still asystole...
DOCTOR VÉLEZ,"Ma'am. I am afraid you’re baby is stillborn. She had no amniotic liquid. And the green liquid blocked her lungs. I am so sorry, señora."
PEDIATRICIAN,"I am so sorry, Cleo..."
PEDIATRICIAN,"Would you like to say good bye to your baby, ma'am?"
DOCTOR VÉLEZ,Who are you with? Can we call someone?
DOCTOR VÉLEZ,She’s with family. They’re outside.
CLEO,"Did you say something, Cleo. I couldn’t hear you..."
DOCTOR VÉLEZ,Señora Sofía... Señora Sofía...
NURSE,"Yes, Cleo, I will give her a call..."
ADELA (O.C.),May I? Ma'am?
ADELA (O.C.),Move it!
PACO,It’s the sharpener! Move it! Cleo!
PEPE,Toño! Sofi! Come!
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Mom bought a new car!
PACO,You like it?
SEÑORA SOFÍA,How fast can it go?
TOÑO,You check.
PACO,Why not a Maverick?
SEÑORA SOFÍA,It only goes to 145! The Galaxie goes up to 200!
SOFI,Because they’re very expensive and I want a small car. I’ve had it up to here with that Galaxie!
PACO,"I like the new car, mommy."
SEÑORA SOFÍA,What about the Galaxie?
SOFI,I sold it. They’re coming to pick it up next week.
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Does dad know?
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"No, it’s a surprise."
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"Hi, Cleo. Do you like the new car?"
SOFI,"And speaking of surprises, we’re going on a trip this weekend and we’re taking the Galaxie on its goodbye ride."
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Where to?
PACO,Tuxpan.
TOÑO,Where’s Tuxpan?
SEÑORA SOFÍA,I have practice!
PACO,You’ll skip it. Tuxpan is in Veracruz.
SEÑORA SOFÍA,It’s the beach?
TOÑO,Yes.
TOÑO (O.C.),The beach in Veracruz is so ugly.
PACO (O.C.),La Pantera doesn’t get all the way here.
SEÑORA SOFÍA (O.C.),I heard it for a little bit.
PACO,Look! The sea!
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"Stop, stop, stop! Ma!"
TOÑO,Why don’t we go drop the bags off at the hotel first?
PACO,By the time we get there it’ll be dark.
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Let’s go! Just for a little while.
PEPE,OK. Only for a little bit though.
PEPE,Cat got your tongue?
PACO,Then why don’t you talk.
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Ay! Ay ! Ay...!
PACO,I told you to put on your T-shirt.
SEÑORA SOFÍA,But it was cloudy!
SEÑORA SOFÍA,That’s why! The glare is worse than the sun!
PEPE,Are you dressed Pepe?
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"Yes, but the cat got Cleo’s tongue."
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Children?
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Children?
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Pay attention! I have something to tell you.
SOFI,Your dad’s not in Ottawa.
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Is he back?!
SEÑORA SOFÍA,No. Your dad never went anywhere.
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"Well, yes. But he only went for a week and... your father’s not coming back home."
PACO,We came on this trip so he could come get his things from the house.
SEÑORA SOFÍA,What things?
PACO,"His things. Or what he says are his things. His clothes, the bookshelves..."
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Are you getting a divorce?
SOFI,He says he doesn’t know.
SEÑORA SOFÍA,He doesn’t love us anymore?
TOÑO,Dad loves you very much. He says he wants to see you.
SEÑORA SOFÍA,When?
SEÑORA SOFÍA,He says he doesn’t know when... Soon.
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"There will be many changes, but we’ll be together and it’ll be an adventure."
TOÑO,I’m starting a new full time job in publishing next week.
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Publishing? But you’re a chemist.
PACO,"I know, but your father hasn’t sent any money yet and teaching high school is not enough. Plus, I love books and I never liked chemistry. It’ll be another adventure."
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Are you going to come in?
PACO,I have to go check on the tires since we’re leaving tomorrow early. You coming?
SOFI,No. It’s our last day at the beach.
SEÑORA SOFÍA,I’m staying too.
PACO,"But if I leave, you can’t go in. If something happens, Cleo can’t swim."
SEÑORA SOFÍA,But it’s so mellow.
PACO,"I don’t care. If you want to stay, those are the rules."
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Not even by the edge?
PACO AND SOFI,"By the edge is fine. But just here, understood?"
PEPE,Yes...
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Me too?
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"Yes, but right by the shore."
CLEO,Can I leave them with you? I won’t take long.
PEPE,Just right by the shore.
CLEO,Aaaah!
PEPE,Paco! Just in the shallow water! Sofi!
CLEO,Carry me.
CLEO,No way. You can do it alone. It’s not hot anymore.
PACO (O.C.),Paco! I see you! Back to the shore!
CLEO,But we’re at the shore!
CLEO,"Come closer! You heard your mother, if you don’t come in, you have to get out!"
CLEO,Suit yourself. You’re just getting more sand on you and I was going to clean you up in the palapa.
PEPE,Hey! I’m watching you guys!
CLEO,Did you know when I was grown up I was a sailor?
PEPE,Mmmhmmm...
CLEO,"Yes, and I drowned in a storm."
CLEO,Mmmhmmm...
PEPE,Paco and Sofi! Closer!
CLEO,But the waves were so big....
CLEO,Get back!
PEPE,Closer!
CLEO,And it was night and there was so much lightning... and I didn’t know how to swim...
CLEO,Stay there Pepe.
CLEO,Help your sister!
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Pepe! I told you to stay there!
SOFI,"Are you OK, my love?"
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Cleo saved us...
CLEO,"Thank you, thank you, thank you Cleo..."
SEÑORA SOFÍA,I didn’t want her... I didn’t want her...
CLEO,"Shhh, shhh, shhh... They’re OK. The kids are OK...."
CLEO,I didn’t want her... I didn’t want her to be born...
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Poor little girl! ... I didn’t want her to be born! ... I didn’t want her to be born!...
CLEO,"It’s going to be all right, Cleo... It’s going to be all right..."
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Tie the dog ...
TOÑO,"You too, kids. Don’t play dumb and come help us with the things."
PACO,It’s horrible. It’s horrible without the bookshelves...
TOÑO,I like it better this way...
SOFI,It’s awful.
SEÑORA SOFÍA,What’s so horrible mommy?
SOFI,He doesn’t like the hallway without the bookshelves.
SEÑORA SOFÍA,What bookshelves?
SOFI,The ones that used to be in the hall.
PEPE,Oh! You’re right!
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Wow! It looks bigger!
SOFI,What did you think about our adventure?
ADELA,I liked it a lot.
CLEO,"I’m going to the store, there’s no ham. How was it then?"
PEPE (O.S.),Real pretty. Go. I’ll tell you about it later.
SEÑORA SOFÍA,The desk is gone too!
PACO,And we’ll have other adventures. And we’ll travel a lot.
SEÑORA SOFÍA,We’ll go to Dinseyland?
SEÑORA SOFÍA,We don’t have enough money...
PEPE,But we can go on adventures in the car. What if we went to a ghost mining town in the desert?
PACO,And there’s ghosts?
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"No, silly. That’s what you call towns that are abandoned. And what’s over there?"
SOFI,"Nothing. Just the town and the abandoned mine. Or we could go to the Lacandon jungle, or Oaxaca..."
PACO,"Oaxaca, Yes! And we could visit Cleo’s village."
SOFI,I was there.
CLEO,Finders keepers...
CLEO,"Hello? Yes, thank you ma’am... Yes just a moment..."
SEÑORA SOFÍA,Señora Sofi? It’s señora Molly calling.
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"Don’t fight. You sit here, Paco."
PEPE,"Hello, comadre. How are you? I’m just back from Tuxpan..."
SOFI,Cleo? Can you bring me a banana milkshake?
CLEO,Me too?
PACO,"Sure. Just lemme take these clothes up to wash. Do you want something, Paco?"
CLEO,Any Gansitos?
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"I’m not sure, but if not, I’ll go get some later."
SEÑORA SOFÍA,"Yes, it was wonderful... Yes, the kids are all right... No... lovely! .... good..."
,Well Paco and Sofi scared the living daylights out of me...
