BOBBY RYDELL,Thank you very much! Welcome to Jules Podell’s Copacabana! I’m Bobby Rydell and I’m happy to be here!
LOSCUDO,That old Black Magic has me in its spell...
COAT-CHECK GIRL,Guard this hat with your life... My mother gave it to me.
CARMINE,"Yes, Mr. Loscudo..."
LOSCUDO,Joey!
CARMINE,"Hey, Carmine!"
LOSCUDO,That’s not necessary...
CARMINE,Come on. You know I saw this kid Rydell last year in Philly. Nobody knew who he was.
LIP,Well they know him now...
COAT-CHECK GIRL,Gimme Loscudo’s hat.
LIP,But he said...
PODELL,"I know, just give it to me..."
GOOMBAH,TONY LIIIIIIIIIIIIIP!!!
LIP,"YOU PUT YOUR HANDS ON ME, YOU PUNK?!"
GOOMBAH,Do yourself a favor--go home with your friends.
LIP,Don’t you tell me where to go! Do you know who I am?! I’m goin’ back in there!
BOBBY RYDELL (O.S.),"Nah, you’re not."
LOSCUDO,"...Whoa, that old Black Magic called loooooooove!"
COAT-CHECK GIRL,I‘ll burn this place down! Where’s my hat!
LOSCUDO,"I’m sorry, Mr. Loscudo, I went to the ladies room, I was only gone a minute..."
CARMINE,Someone better find it!
LOSCUDO,"It’ll turn up, I swear it’ll turn up."
CARMINE,"Really? You tell that fat Jew bastard Podell that if it doesn’t turn up, I’ll burn this place down! You hear me? I’ll burn the Copa down!"
DANNY,Jesus Christ. Loscudo is out of his mind.
CARMINE,We earned our money tonight.
LIP,"Lip, I thought you were gonna kill that guy."
DANNY,Better him than me. What are you gonna do while we’re closed?
LIP,I don’t know. Maybe work at my Uncle’s pizza joint.
CARMINE,What about you?
JULES PODELL,I’m gonna drink for two months.
LOSCUDO,"Take me home, Lip."
LIP,"My hat! Jesus Christ, if you had tits, I’d kiss ya! How the hell’d you find it?"
LOSCUDO,"Heard it was missing, so I looked into it."
LIP,I wanted to kill that broad.
JILLY RIZZO,Wasn’t her fault.
LIP,Who had the balls to clip it?
LOSCUDO,"Don’t worry about it, I took care of him."
LIP,I hope you gave him some beating.
LOSCUDO,"No, I can’t. It was my pleasure, Mr. Loscudo."
DOLORES,"Bullshit. And from now on you don’t have to call me Mister Loscudo, ya hear me?"
LIP,‘Morning...
"CLOSE ON - A BLACK AND WHITE TV, THE YANKEES PLAY THE SAN",‘Night...
PHIL RIZUTTO (V.O.),"FRANCISCO GIANTS, GAME 6 OF THE WORLD SERIES."
JOHNNY,"“Roger Maris at the plate, Pierce checks the signs...”"
RUDY,"Come on, Roger! Hit one out!"
LIP,"Be quiet, you’re gonna jinx it!"
JOHNNY,"Johnny, think you can yell a little louder?"
LIP,Maris is up...
JOHNNY,"Yeah, so am I now. What the hell are you guys doing here?"
ANTHONY,Figured we’d come up and keep Dolores company...
NICOLA,"You shouldn’t be sleeping in the middle of the day, leaving my daughter here alone with these sacks of coal."
LIP,And why do you hire them to do an Italian’s job? It’s a disgrace.
BLACK WORKMAN,I don’t know who they’re gonna send.
PHIL RIZUTTO (V.O.),"Thank you, ma’am."
DOLORES,"“Deep to center field, holy cow he did it! A home run for Roger Maris! Holy cow!”"
DOLORES,"Get dressed, Tony, we’re gonna eat."
NICOLA,"Bless us our Lord, for these thy gifts, which we are about to receive, from thy bounty through Christ our Lord, Amen."
DOLORES,Salute.
LIP,"If anyone hears about a job for Tony, let us know."
RUDY,Dolores...
DOLORES,"What happened, you get fired?"
JOHNNY,"No, Copa’s closing for repairs. He needs something for just a couple months."
NICOLA,I’ll ask around.
LIP,"Mister big shot. Always spend, spend, spend. No job, he gets himself a new kitchen floor."
FRAN,"Come on, Pop. The kids were gettin’ splinters in their feet."
JOHNNY,"All the people he knows, he’ll find something."
LIP,He had a great job at the sanitation department.
JOHNNY,You shouldn’t have punched out the foreman.
FAT PAULIE,He shouldn’t have woke me up.
FRANKIE,"I’m tellin’ you, this is gonna be the easiest fifty bucks you ever made."
FAT PAULIE,Johnny told me you ate forty-eight White Castle burgers in one sitting.
LIP,Cheeseburgers.
GORMAN,I don’t believe you.
JOHNNY,What do I care if you believe me?
FAT PAULIE,"Gorman, who’s got the record for hotdogs here?"
GORMAN,Fat Paulie. Fifteen.
LIP,Why wasn’t Lip in on that contest?
FAT PAULIE,What contest? I was hungry.
JOHNNY,Bet’s simple. Half a C-note. Most hotdogs in an hour wins. With toppings.
FAT PAULIE,What the hell you weigh?
LIP,Two-sixty.
JOHNNY,Aaaaay. Your left ass weighs two- sixty.
LIP,May my mother-in-law drop dead on the spot if I’m lyin’.
NICK,"Okay, you’re on."
DOLORES,"Come on, Lip, pick it up! The baby elephant just hit nineteen!"
LIP,"Nicky, you doin’ your homework?"
DOLORES,Yeah.
LIP,Where were you?
DOLORES,Gorman’s. Fat Paulie bet me fifty bucks he could eat more hot dogs than me. He knocked off twenty- eight. Guy’s an animal.
LIP,Are you crazy--you lost fifty dollars?!
JULES PODELL,"Dolores, please. I ate thirty."
LIP,Thank God. The gas bill came in today.
JULES PODELL,Yeah?
WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.),"Hey, Lip, some guy called over here -- a doctor’s lookin’ for a driver. You interested?"
BOX OFFICE MANAGER,Yeah.
LIP,They’re interviewing guys tomorrow afternoon. Here’s the address.
BOX OFFICE MANAGER,Excuse me. We’re not open right now...
LIP,But you’re welcome to buy tickets to tonight’s performance.
LIP (CONT’D),‘There a doctor’s office ‘round here? I think I got the wrong address.
AMIT,"You have the correct address. Dr. Shirley lives upstairs, above the hall."
LIP,I’m here for the driver job. Tony Lip.
AMIT,I should be on there.
LIP,No Tony Lip. I do have a Tony Val...Valle...
AMIT,Vallelonga. That’s me.
AMIT,Fill this out while you wait.
VOICE (O.S.),What?
DR. SHIRLEY,Fill. It. Out. While you wait.
LIP,Take a seat.
DR. SHIRLEY,"Mr. Vallelonga, sorry to keep you waiting..."
LIP,I’m Dr. Donald Shirley.
LIP (CONT’D),Hi. Tony.
DR. SHIRLEY,"Please, have a seat."
LIP,This is some place you got here.
DR. SHIRLEY,Them horns real?
LIP,Elephant tusks. Yes.
LIP (CONT’D),What about that? That a molar?
DR. SHIRLEY,A what?
LIP,A molar.
DR. SHIRLEY,Like a shark tooth? Or a tiger’s?
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),"Um, no. It was a gift."
LIP,Oh.
LIP (CONT’D),I thought I was going to an office. They said a doctor needed a driver.
DR. SHIRLEY,That’s all they told you?
LIP,"Actually, it’s a bit more complicated than that. Have you ever driven professionally before?"
DR. SHIRLEY,Sanitation.
LIP,Garbage trucks.
DR. SHIRLEY,Plus I drive my boss home at night. I can drive anything.
LIP,I see. What other experience do you have?
DR. SHIRLEY,"I worked a lot of joints. The Wagon Wheel, Peppermint Lounge, Copa..."
LIP,In what capacity?
DR. SHIRLEY,What do you mean?
LIP,What did you do there?
DR. SHIRLEY,Public relations...
LIP,"Well, first of all, Tony, I’m not a medical doctor. I’m a musician."
DR. SHIRLEY,You mean like songs?
LIP,"Yes. I’m about to start a concert tour, the majority of which will be down South."
DR. SHIRLEY,Atlantic City?
LIP,"The deep south. We start in the midwest, but then we’re taking a hard left. Kentucky, North Carolina, Tennessee, and on down through the Delta."
DR. SHIRLEY,Do you foresee any issues working for a black man?
LIP,"No, no... ’fact just yesterday me and the wife had a couple colored guys over the house. For drinks."
DR. SHIRLEY,"Oh, I see. You’re married."
LIP,Yup. Two kids.
DR. SHIRLEY,I don’t know if this is the proper job for a married man.
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),"Why, we bringing broads?"
LIP,"My point is, you’ll be gone for eight straight weeks--with no breaks--right up until Christmas. You’re quite sure you can leave your family for that long?"
DR. SHIRLEY,Depends on what you’re paying.
LIP,"Ninety dollars a week, plus room and board. But let me be crystal clear... I’m not simply hiring a chauffeur. I need someone who can handle my itinerary. I need a personal assistant. I need a valet. I need someone who will launder my clothes, shine my shoes..."
BOBBY,"Good luck, Doc."
CUSTOMER,Tony...
BOBBY,I had my record label ask around town to find me the right man. Your name came up more than once. You’ve impressed a lot of people by the way you handle... trouble. That’s why I called and asked about your availability.
LIP,"Look, I got no problem being on the road with you. But I ain’t no butler, I ain’t ironing shirts, and I’m not shining nobody’s shoes. You need someone to get you from point A to point B? You need someone to make sure there’s no problems along the way -- and you going through the deep South, believe me, there’s gonna be problems. So if you want me, it’s gotta be a buck and a quarter a week. Or go hire the little Chink that just pranced out of here and see how far you get."
BOBBY,"Well, Mr. Vallelonga...thank you for coming in."
AUGIE,"Bobby, give me a Rheingold. Ice cold."
AUGIE (CONT’D),Mister Tony. Augie asking about you.
LIP,"Come on, I’m dying of thirst over here!"
AUGIE,"Shut up, I’m talking!"
AUGIE (CONT’D),When?
AUGIE (CONT’D),Now. He in his box.
LIP,Tony Lip. What the hell happened at the Copa? I heard you split a guy’s face open.
AUGIE,That guy you hit. He was one of Charlie the Hand’s crew.
LIP,Then he shoulda known better.
AUGIE,"The Hand wanted me to look into it. I spoke to Podell. Whole thing was over a piece of ass, right?"
LIP,A beef like that should never happen in the club. They were out of line. So we squashed it.
AUGIE,Sit down. Have something to eat.
LIP,"Thanks, but I already ate."
PAWN GUY,You looking to earn some extra scharole? I could keep you busy while the Copa’s down.
PAWN GUY (CONT’D),What I gotta do?
LIP,Things...
DOLORES,"Appreciate it, but I’m gonna spend some time with the family."
LIP,"Don’t be stupid. You can make a few bucks, buy something nice for your wife."
DOLORES,I’m good. I’m flush right now.
LIP,"Here’s fifty. Give me sixty before Christmas, you get it back."
DOLORES,"Hey, Lip... everything okay?"
LIP,"You got beak trouble, Charlie? Mind your business."
DOLORES,So what happened with the doctor interview?
LIP,"He ain’t a real doctor, he’s a piano player."
LIP,I don’t understand--why’d they say he was a doctor?
DOLORES,I don’t know. I think he’s like a doctor of piano-playing or something.
LIP,You can be that?
DOLORES,"I guess. He lives on top of Carnegie Hall. You shoulda seen this place, Dee--it was filled with statues and all kinds of fancy crap. And he was sitting on a friggin’ throne all dressed up like the king of the jungle bunnies."
LIP,He’s colored? You wouldn’t last a week with him.
DOLORES,"For the right money, I would."
DOLORES (CONT’D),"Hello... Yeah... Really?... Why?... Okay, hold on."
DOLORES (CONT’D),Everything okay?
DOLORES (CONT’D),It’s him.
LIP,Who?
DOLORES,"Dr. Shirley, the piano guy. He wants to talk to you."
LIP,Me? What? Why?
DOLORES,"Hello... Good morning, Doctor, nice to talk to you, too..."
RECORD EXEC,"Yes, that is a long time..."
LIP,"It is...Yes, I’m sure...Thank you for calling...Goodbye."
RECORD EXEC,What he say?
RECORD EXEC (CONT’D),He wanted to know if I’d be okay with him taking my husband away from his family for two months. He said he’d pay you what you asked for.
LIP,"It’s good money, Dolores. You know we need it. I can’t be eatin’ thirty hot dogs every day."
RECORD EXEC,I know...I said it was okay for you to go.
RECORD EXEC (CONT’D),Here’s the first half of your pay. You’ll get the rest when the tour’s over.
LIP,"Uh-uh, I gotta get paid every week."
RECORD EXEC,"Sorry, that’s not how the record company does it."
RECORD EXEC (CONT’D),We gotta have some guarantee you’ll finish the job.
JOHNNY,"Why the hell wouldn’t I finish the job? I took it, didn’t I?"
LIP,Then you’ve got nothing to worry about.
JOHNNY,"Here’s the deal, Mr. Vallelonga. It’s your job to get Don to all his tour dates on time. If he misses any shows, you’re not getting your back-end."
LIP,He’s not gonna miss any shows.
JOHNNY,Good. And you’re going to need this.
DOLORES,"It’s the book I told you about. Sometimes you’re staying in the same hotels, and sometimes you’re not."
LIP,Madonne. This the new one?
DOLORES,The record company rented it.
LIP,So what’d my sister say about you being gone for three weeks?
DOLORES,Eight weeks.
LIP,"Yeah, right. Ten-to-one you slap the moolie out and come home under a month."
DOLORES,Come here. Say goodbye to your father.
LIP,"Stop that. You gotta be big boys, take care of your mother..."
DOLORES,Did you go to the A-A-A for the maps?
LIP,The record guy gave me maps and directions with the itinerary thing. And this.
DOLORES,The Negro Motorist Green-Book?
LIP,Lists all the places coloreds can stay down south. Like if you’re traveling while black.
DOLORES,Traveling while black?
LIP,Yeah. Like if you’re black but you gotta travel for some reason.
DOLORES,They got a special book for that?
LIP,I guess.
DOLORES,Did you pack an iron?
LIP,"I ain’t lugging around no iron, Dee."
DOLORES,How you gonna keep your pants pressed?
LIP,I’ll put ‘em under my mattress.
LIP (CONT’D),I want you to write me a letter every chance you get.
LIP (CONT’D),"Aw, come on, Dee, I can’t write letters."
DOLORES,Take you five minutes. Promise me.
LIP,"I can’t write, it’s embarrassing-- they ain’t gonna be no good."
DOLORES,"It’s a lot cheaper than callin’ long distance, Tony. Promise me you’ll write."
NICOLA,Okay. I promise. I’ll try.
LIP,Yeah.
LIP (CONT’D),Put this in the bank today.
OLEG,I made a couple veal-cutlet sandwiches for you and Dr. Shirley. Be careful. I love you.
GEORGE,"Love you, too."
DR. SHIRLEY,You better be home at Christmas or don’t come home at all!
AMIT,He who arrives late has no bed!
DR. SHIRLEY,Bum a smoke?
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),I’m Tony. You the band?
LIP,Oleg. Cello.
LIP (CONT’D),"George. Bass. And we’re not a band, we’re a trio."
DR. SHIRLEY,"Thank you, Amit."
LIP,"Have a wonderful trip, Doctor."
DR. SHIRLEY,"Tony, when we arrive in a city, the first thing I’d like you to do is check the piano where I’m playing. Make sure it’s a Steinway as per my contract."
LIP,And could you see to it that I have a bottle of Cutty Sark in my room every night.
DR. SHIRLEY,Every night?
LIP,Well if you ever need any help with that...
DR. SHIRLEY,"I won’t. And ten-and-two on the wheel, please."
LIP,"Doc, I noticed on the itinerary thing there that the last show’s December 23rd."
DR. SHIRLEY,"Birmingham, yes. It’s a Christmas show."
OLEG,Any way we could hit the road early the next morning so we could be back home in time for Christmas Eve?
DR. SHIRLEY,We’ll see. Could you please put the cigarette out?
OLEG,Why?
DR. SHIRLEY,Because I can’t breathe back here.
LIP,What are you talking about? Smoke’s going into my lungs. I’m doing all the work here.
LIP (CONT’D),Thank you.
DR. SHIRLEY,Everything okay?
LIP,Yes. Everything’s fine.
LIP (CONT’D),Good. We’ll meet you at the hotel in Pittsburgh.
DR. SHIRLEY,Make a reservation for dinner. We’ll rehearse immediately after. See you there.
LIP,Hell’s he looking at?
DR. SHIRLEY,"You speak German, huh?"
LIP,That was Russian.
DR. SHIRLEY,"Yeah, I was stationed in Germany in the army. I can pick up a little of what you’re sayin’. Be careful, Krauts are all sneaks. Kennedy shoulda bombed ‘em when we had the chance--plus now them Cuban bastards."
LIP,Where they going anyway? Ain’t they supposed to be following us?
DR. SHIRLEY,"They have the itinerary. As long as they make it to the shows on time, I don’t worry and you shouldn’t either."
LIP,I ain’t worried about nothin’.
DR. SHIRLEY,How is that?
LIP,Salty.
DR. SHIRLEY,Have you ever thought of being a food critic?
LIP,"Not really, but...why? Is there money in that?"
LIP (CONT’D),"I’m just saying, you have a marvelous way with words when describing food. Salty. So vivid. One can almost taste it."
DR. SHIRLEY,"I’m saying it’s salty, and salt’s cheatin’. Any cook can make things salty. But to make it taste good without the salt, with just the other flavors, that’s the trick. See, when you--"
LIP,We should be going soon if we expect to get to Pittsburgh by dinner.
DR. SHIRLEY,"You know, when I was in the army I knew a guy from Pittsburgh, but he called it Titsburgh because he said all the girls there have big tits."
LIP,"That’s absurd. Why would women in Pittsburgh have larger breasts than, say, women in New York?"
DR. SHIRLEY,"‘The hell I know? Guess we’ll find out, huh?"
LIP,"By the way, when you hired me, my wife went out bought one of your records--’one about the orphans."
DR. SHIRLEY,Orphans?
LIP,Yeah. Cover had a bunch of kids sitting around a campfire?
DR. SHIRLEY,Orpheus.
LIP,What?
DR. SHIRLEY,Orpheus in the Underworld. It’s based on a French Opera. And those kids on the cover? They were demons in hell.
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),No shit? Must of been naughty kids.
LIP,What are you doing?
DR. SHIRLEY,I gotta take a leak.
LIP,Here? Now?
DR. SHIRLEY,"What, you want me to piss my pants?"
LIP,"Take this for any incidentals we may need. If you want something for yourself, you don’t have to ask me, just make sure you keep the receipts. When it runs low, let me know."
DR. SHIRLEY,"One more thing--we will be attending many events before and after the concerts, interacting with some of the wealthiest and most highly-educated people in the country. It is my feeling that your diction, as charming as it may be in the tri-state area, could use a bit of finessing."
LIP,Like you mean diction in what way?
DR. SHIRLEY,In the only way the word “diction” is ever used.
LIP,Okay...
DR. SHIRLEY,"Your intonation, inflection, choice of words--"
LIP,"Ayyyy, I got my own problems, I gotta worry what other people think about the way I talk?"
DR. SHIRLEY,There are simple techniques I can teach you that are quite effective. I can help you.
LIP,"I don’t need no goddamn help. If people don’t like the way I talk, they can go take a shit."
DR. SHIRLEY,The profanity is another issue.
LIP,"A fanabla, why you breakin’ my balls?"
DR. SHIRLEY,"Because you can do better. And here’s another thing--as guest of honor, I will be announced when I enter these intimate events. You will be announced as well. Vallelonga may be difficult to pronounce. I was thinking “Valle” would be more appropriate. Tony Valle. It’s short and simple."
MC,"Nuh-uh. If they got a problem with Vallelonga, they can call me Tony Lip."
LIP,These are genteel people. That might be a little...worldly for them.
MC,"Then it’s Tony Vallelonga. All these high-class people that are so much smarter than me, with all their intelligence and speakin’ abilities, you’re telling me they can’t pronounce my name?"
PULL BACK - A CRAPS GAME BEING PLAYED OUT BETWEEN PARKED,"I’m just telling you, Valle will make things easier."
BUSBOY,"My last name is Vallelonga and I ain’t changing it for nobody. They don’t like it, they can shove it up their ass--I’ll just wait outside."
LIP,A sound compromise.
DR. SHIRLEY (O.S.),"Ladies and gentlemen, tonight we are privileged to present a great American artist. He gave his first public performance at the age of three. At age eighteen, at Arthur Fiedler's invitation, our guest made his concert debut with the Boston Pops. He holds Doctorates in Psychology, in Music, and in the Liturgical Arts, and has performed at the White House twice in the last fourteen months. He is a true virtuoso."
CHAUFFEUR,Virtuoso--that’s Italian. Means he’s really good.
LIP,"Ladies and gentleman, please welcome The Don Shirley Trio!"
BUSBOY,"CARS... DICE, DOLLAR BILLS, and QUARTERS ON THE GROUND."
LIP,Shit! He won again!
DR. SHIRLEY,"Hey, it’s your dice, I’m just having a lucky day."
LIP,Tony!
DR. SHIRLEY,Boss man’s callin’.
LIP,He ain’t my boss. I work for the record company.
DR. SHIRLEY,Come on! Give us a chance to win back our loot!
LIP,"Sorry, fellas, duty calls!"
DR. SHIRLEY,I’ve been looking for you.
LIP,Sorry. The guys were having a little game.
DR. SHIRLEY,"If you need extra money, next time, ask me."
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),It’s more fun winning it.
LIP (V.O.),What if you lost?
DOLORES,"Craps and cards, I don’t lose, Doc. I don’t lose."
DR. SHIRLEY,And stooping down in the gravel throwing dice for pocket change makes you a winner?
LIP,What are you giving me shit for? Everybody was doin’ it.
DR. SHIRLEY,They didn’t have a choice whether to be inside or out. You did.
LIP,"Let’s go. And wipe your knees, you’ve got dirt on them."
DR. SHIRLEY,Dear Dolores... How are you? I am fine...
LIP,"“I’m eating real good--hamburgers mostly--so don’t worry about me not eating good. We are doing lots of driving around, and we talk a lot in the car. I saw Dr. Shirley tonight play piano. He doesn’t play like a colored guy. He plays like Liberace but better and I ain’t lying. He’s like a genius I think. When I look at him in the rear-view mirror, I can tell he’s always thinking and working stuff out in his head, I guess that’s what geniuses do. But it don’t look fun to be that smart. I miss you very very much, Baby. Love, Tony. P.S.-- I told you I can’t write letters, ha ha! Regards to your father and brother. I’m going to get a haircut tomorrow. P.S.--Kiss Nickie and Frankie both for me.”"
DR. SHIRLEY,Who is this?
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),What?
LIP,On the radio.
DR. SHIRLEY,Lil’ Richard.
LIP,This is Little Richard?
DR. SHIRLEY,"Yeah, he’s good. Think you could play somethin’ like this, Doc?"
LIP,I don’t know. Sounds very complicated.
DR. SHIRLEY,So where did this “Tony the Lip” moniker come from?
LIP,Not Tony the Lip. Tony Lip--it’s one word. I got it when I was a kid. My friends said I was the best bullshit artist in the Bronx.
DR. SHIRLEY,Why are you smiling?
LIP,Huh?
LIP,You don’t mind that your friends-- the people closest to you--consider you a liar?
DR. SHIRLEY,"I never said liar, I said bullshit artist."
LIP,What’s the difference?
DR. SHIRLEY,"I don’t lie. I’m just good at, you know, talking people into doin’ things they don’t wanna do. By bullshittin’ ‘em."
LIP,And you’re proud of that?
DR. SHIRLEY,Well it got me this job.
LIP,You’re full of shit! You never hearda Chubby Checker?
DR. SHIRLEY,"Of course I’ve heard of him, I just never heard his music."
LIP,This is what everyone dances to now --
DR. SHIRLEY,Eyes on the road please.
LIP,How about this? You know this song.
DR. SHIRLEY,I don’t think so...
LIP,"How could you not know this music? Chubby Checker, Lil’ Richard, Sam Cooke, Aretha--these are your people!"
DR. SHIRLEY,"Before we pull out, Tony, we need to talk. I just heard something that disturbed me a great deal. I gave you petty cash."
LIP,"Yeah, so?"
DR. SHIRLEY,Oleg told me what you did.
LIP,What I do?
DR. SHIRLEY,You stole a jade stone from the store.
LIP,No I didn’t.
DR. SHIRLEY,He watched you do it.
LIP,I didn’t steal no stone.
DR. SHIRLEY,You picked it up and you put it in your pocket.
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),"Yeah, I picked a rock up off the ground--I didn’t steal one from the box."
LIP,Why would you pick up a rock off the ground?
DR. SHIRLEY,‘Cause that ain’t stealin’. It’s just a regular rock.
LIP,But why would you want a regular rock?
DR. SHIRLEY,"I don’t know, just to have. Like for good luck maybe."
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),A lucky rock? Let me see it.
LIP,I want you to go back and pay for it.
DR. SHIRLEY,I told you that Kraut was a sneak. Rats me out for something I didn’t even do.
LIP,"Pay for the stone, Tony, you’ll feel better."
LIP,"I feel fine, and I’m not paying for no regular rock I found in the dirt."
STAGE MANAGER,"Do not drive, Mr. Vallelonga."
LIP,Feel better?
STAGE MANAGER,No.
LIP,"Tony, if you’d like, I will happily buy you that stone."
STAGE MANAGER,Don’t bother. You took all the fun out of it.
LIP,Excuse me... I’m with the band.
STAGE MANAGER,You’re all set up.
LIP,"This ain’t the piano, right?"
STAGE MANAGER,That’s it.
LIP,This isn’t a Steinway...?
STAGE MANAGER,So what?
LIP,Dr. Shirley only plays on Steinway-brand pianos. It’s in his written contract.
STAGE MANAGER,Who’s Dr. Shirley?
LIP,Dr. Shirley--the Don Shirley Trio?
STAGE MANAGER,Does it really matter?
LIP,"Yes, it does. It’s in his contract."
STAGE MANAGER,"Come on, what’s the difference -- these coons can play on anything."
LIP,But there’s garbage in this thing.
STAGE MANAGER,"So, take it out."
LIP,What’d you say?
STAGE MANAGER,You heard me.
-- LIP SITS IN A DINER WRITING A LETTER. SHIRLEY IS ACROSS,Get a clean Steinway in here.
LIP (V.O.),There’s no Steinway on campus.
LIP (V.O.),Not my problem.
LIP (V.O.),I bet there ain’t two Steinways in the whole state of Indiana.
"-- DR. SHIRLEY’S CAR DRIVING ON VARIOUS HIGHWAYS, WITH",Then you better move your ass and start lookin’.
LIP (V.O.),"Who you think you’re talking to, greaseball?"
LIP (V.O.),"FROM HIM, READING A NEWSPAPER."
"-- SHIRLEY LOWERS HIS NEWSPAPER, GLANCES AT LIP’S CHICKEN-",“Dear Dolores... This morning I had steak and eggs. For breakfast.”
LIP,"“The band has been playing at very ritzy joints. Dr. Shirley and I are getting along pretty good, but sometimes I think he gets depressed and drinks too much.”"
LIP,"“I never knew how very beautiful this country was. Now that I’m seeing it I know. You wouldn’t believe how beautiful nature is--it is as beautiful as they say. I wish I had a camera and took some pictures, they would be collector’s items, I wish I knew how to describe it to you.”"
DR. SHIRLEY,"AMAZING VIEWS OF THE COUNTRYSIDE... SIGNS FOR NEENAH, WISCONSIN... MUSCATINE, IOWA... INDIANAPOLIS... ST. LOUIS..."

LIP,"Got any family, Doc?"
DR. SHIRLEY,Not really.
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),Not really? Either you do or you don’t.
LIP,"It’s a long story, Tony."
LIP,"What, we’re in a rush now?"
DR. SHIRLEY,"I have a brother somewhere. We used to get together once in a while...but it got more and more difficult to keep in touch. That’s the curse of being a musician-- you’re always on the road, like a carnival worker, or a criminal."
LIP,It took a toll on my marriage as well.
DR. SHIRLEY,You’re married?
LIP,Was.
DR. SHIRLEY,"June was a good person--terrible grammar, but a kind soul. Unfortunately, I didn’t have the constitution to do a husband act as well as a concert pianist act. I couldn’t balance both worlds."
LIP,Kentucky Fried Chicken... in Kentucky! When’s that ever gonna happen?!
DR. SHIRLEY,What do you want?
LIP,I’m fine. Thank you.
DR. SHIRLEY,"This might be the best Kentucky Fried Chicken I ever had. But I guess it’s fresher down here, right?"
LIP (CONT’D,I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone with your appetite.
DR. SHIRLEY,"No, I bought the bucket so you could have some."
LIP,I’ve never had fried chicken in my life.
DR. SHIRLEY,"Who you bullshittin’? You people love the fried chicken, the grits, the colored greens...I love it, too. The negro cooks used to make it when I was in the army."
LIP,"You have a very narrow assessment of me, Tony."
DR. SHIRLEY,"Yeah, I’m good, right?"
LIP,"What? No. No, you’re not good, you’re bad. I’m saying, just because other negro people listen to a certain kind of music doesn’t mean I have to. Nor do we all have to eat the same food."
LIP (CONT’D),"Whoa, wait a minute. If you said all guineas like pizza and spaghetti and meatballs, I’m not gonna get insulted."
DR. SHIRLEY,You’re missing the point. For you to make the assumption that--
LIP,"Doc, you want some or not?"
DR. SHIRLEY,No.
LIP,Tell me that don’t smell good?
DR. SHIRLEY,"It smells okay, but I don’t want to get grease on my blanket."
LIP,"Oooh, I’m gonna get grease on my blankie--have a piece. It ain’t gonna kill ya."
DR. SHIRLEY,Just grab it and eat it!
LIP,No.
DR. SHIRLEY,I’m gonna throw it in the back seat.
LIP,Don’t you dare!
LIP (CONT’D),Then you better take it.
DR. SHIRLEY,How? Do you even have utensils? Plates?
LIP,"Bah fongool! Eat it with your hands, that’s how you’re supposed to."
LIP (CONT’D),I can’t do that.
DR. SHIRLEY,I swear I’m gonna throw it!
LIP,I... I really can’t do this.
LIP,Eat the goddamn thing.
DR. SHIRLEY,"What, no good?"
LIP,I just... this seems so... so unsanitary.
MAN #1,"‘Gives a shit?! Relax and enjoy it. My father always says, whatever you do, do it hundred percent. When you work, work, when you laugh, laugh, when you eat, eat like it’s your last meal."
DR. SHIRLEY,Want another piece? Have a leg!
MAN #2,What do we do about the bones?
DR. SHIRLEY,We do this.
MAN #1,This can’t be it. Says right here...
MAN #3,...cozy as your own home... This place looks like my ass.
DR. SHIRLEY,This is the place.
LIP,"If you need anything, I’ll be up the street at the Easton Inn. So...see you tomorrow."
GEORGE (O.S.),"Hey, fancy-pants, you wanna play?"
GEORGE (CONT’D),"Um... no, thank you."
GEORGE,"Come on, we short a man!"
LIP (O.S.),I... I’d rather not.
REDNECK #1,"What, you too high and mighty?"
LIP,He’s just afraid of getting that butler uniform all dusty!
REDNECK #1,I’m just... I’m on my way out to meet a friend.
DR. SHIRLEY,Vacation without aggravation... vaffangool.
REDNECK #1,"Tony, it’s George! Wake up! Hurry up!"
LIP,Dr. Shirley’s in trouble.
REDNECK #2,"I went out for a drink, I walk into this bar, and there’s Shirley getting bounced around! I didn’t want to leave him, but I didn’t know what to do!"
LIP,Get your hands off him!
REDNECK #1,"What the good goddamn we got here, fellas?"
LIP,"Hand him over, we walk out, won’t be a problem."
REDNECK #1,"Already is a problem, Mister."
LIP,I just came in for a drink.
REDNECK #2,"You come in here for a drink? Then you must be tired of livin’, boy."
REDNECK #3,"I told you, hand him over, we’ll leave."
MAN’S VOICE (O.S.),"He ain’t going nowhere, we need this brillo pad to wash them dishes with..."
BARKEEP,"Hey, do yourself a favor and let him go. Now."
LIP,Say it nice.
DR. SHIRLEY,I just said it nice.
LIP,"This boy’s gonna get what’s coming to him, and you ain’t got no say!"
DR. SHIRLEY,"Maybe. But, whatever happens, I’m gonna put a bullet right in the middle of that thick skull of yours."
LIP,"He ain’t got no gun, Ray. Let’s get him. He’s fulla shit."
DR. SHIRLEY,What if he ain’t?
LIP,"Well, I sure ain’t."
DR. SHIRLEY,And I won’t be having none of this come to pass in my place. Let the spook go. I want these Yanks off my property.
LIP,What the hell’s wrong with you?! You go in there alone?
DR. SHIRLEY,"I apologize for putting you in that position, Tony."
LIP,"I don’t understand you, Doc, honest to God. Why couldn’t you just drink here--you got a whole bottle?"
DR. SHIRLEY,I needed some air.
LIP,Air?! Don’t you know where you are?
DR. SHIRLEY,Does the geography really matter?
LIP,What?
DR. SHIRLEY,"If I walked into a bar in your neighborhood, would this conversation be any different?"
LIP,From now on you don’t go nowhere without me. Nowhere!
DR. SHIRLEY,Tony...Do you really have a gun?
LIP,‘Course not. Now get some rest. You got a big show tomorrow night. Now where’s your room doc?
DR. SHIRLEY,"Thank you, Louisville, for your warm hospitality!"
MORGAN ANDERSON,“Betty bought... a bit of buttah... but she found the buttah bittah...”
MORGAN ANDERSON (CONT’D),Not buttah... butter. Say the “er.”
MORGAN ANDERSON (CONT’D),Er.
MORGAN ANDERSON (CONT’D),“So Betty bought a bit of better butter to make the bitter butter better...”
LIP,“So Betty bit a buttah...”
WAITER,Don’t be lazy--enunciate. “So Betty bought a bit of better butter...”
LIP,"“So, Betty bit a better buttah--” this is bullshit."
MORGAN ANDERSON,"No, you need to start somewhere. Athletes stretch to warm up before an event. A singer does vocal exercises. These drills will strengthen your speech muscles."
MORGAN ANDERSON (CONT’D),"Ladies and gentlemen, our very special guest from the far north... Don Shirley!"
DR. SHIRLEY,"Accompanying Mr. Shirley, the members of his trio..."
MORGAN ANDERSON (O.S.),"Oleg Malakhov, George Dyer, and his associate, Tony Vallla... Valleg...Valle..."
MORGAN ANDERSON (CONT’D),Valley...lohnja.
DR. SHIRLEY,"Gentlemen, if you don’t mind, I’m going to steal Donnie away for some introductions."
MORGAN ANDERSON,What’s this?
MORGAN ANDERSON (CONT’D),"Pimiento-cheese sandwich, sir."
DR. SHIRLEY,Oof.
MORGAN ANDERSON,"Earlier this week, we asked our help what Mr. Shirley might like for supper. So the boys in the kitchen whipped up a special menu in honor of our guest."
DR. SHIRLEY,"Don, I do hope you enjoy it! Dig in, everyone!"
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),Thank you...thank you. We will return after a brief intermission.
MORGAN ANDERSON,"Excuse me, Don!"
LIP,Lovely work in there!
DR. SHIRLEY,Thank you.
LIP,"Are you looking for the commode? Here, let me help you."
DR. SHIRLEY,It’s right out there ‘fore the pines.
LIP,I’d rather not use that.
DR. SHIRLEY,"Don’t be silly, Don. It looks a lot worse from the outside."
LIP,I understand. But I’m not going in there.
DR. SHIRLEY,"I could go back and use the facilities at my motel, but... that’s going to take at least a half an hour."
LIP,We don’t mind waitin’.
DR. SHIRLEY,Why don’t I just pull over--you can piss in the woods?
LIP,Animals go in the woods.
DR. SHIRLEY,But it’s twenty minutes if we go back to your motel.
LIP,So let’s just get there so I can go back and finish the show.
GEORGE,"Ayyyy. See, that’s the difference between you and me. I’d have zero problem goin’ in the woods."
OLEG,I’m aware.
LIP,Why you sore at me? I don’t make the rules down here.
OLEG,No? Who does?
LIP,"Ay are you sayin’ that just ‘cause I’m white and they’re white? That’s a very prejudice thing you just said there, a very prejudice thing. I got more in common with the hymies at Second Avenue Deli than I got with these hillbilly pricks down here."
OLEG,Eyes on the road.
LIP,"You know, you always say that when you don’t like what I’m saying."
OLEG,Eyes on the road.
LIP,"How does he smile and shake their hands like that? If they tried to pull that outhouse shit with me, I’d piss right on their dining room floor."
DR. SHIRLEY,Don’t do that...
LIP,We have many concert dates left.
DR. SHIRLEY,Yeah...?
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),You realize we are contractually obliged to play them?
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),"Of course I do. If he don’t play ‘em, I don’t get paid. What’s your point?"
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),Ugly circumstances are going to happen again... so control yourself.
LIP,"Don’t lecture me, you rat."
DR. SHIRLEY,"Dr. Shirley could’ve stayed up north getting rear-end kissed at Park Avenue parties for three times money, but he asked for this."
LIP,Why?
DR. SHIRLEY,What on God’s green earth are you doing?
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),A letter.
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),Looks more like a piecemeal ransom note.
LIP,May I?
DR. SHIRLEY,"“Dear, Dolores--I’m meeting all the highly leading citizens of the town, people who use big words, all of them, but you know me, I get by, I’m a good bullshitter.”"
LIP,Two “t”s in “bullshitter.”
DR. SHIRLEY,"“As I’m writing this letter, I’m eating potato chips and I’m starting to get thirsty. I washed my socks last night and dried them on the TV. I should have brung the iron.”"
LIP,"You know this is pathetic, right?"
DR. SHIRLEY,Tell me what you’re trying to say.
LIP,"I don’t know. Just... you know, how I miss her and shit."
DR. SHIRLEY,Then tell her that. But try to say it in a manner that no one has ever said it.
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),Shit...
LIP,And without profanity.
DR. SHIRLEY,"Put this down. “Dolores, when I think of you, I’m reminded of the beautiful plains of Iowa.”"
LIP,Put it down.
LIP (V.O.),“When-I-think-of-you-I’m-reminded- of-the-beautiful...”
LIP (V.O.),Plains of Iowa.
DR. SHIRLEY,What planes?
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),The plains. P-L-A-I-N-S. Those big fields we saw.
LIP,"Oh, those were nice."
DR. SHIRLEY,“...plains of Iowa--which is what they call big fields around here.”
LIP,"Tony, no expounding."
DR. SHIRLEY,No what?
LIP,Just write what I say.
DR. SHIRLEY,“The distance between us is breaking my spirit... My time and experiences without you are meaningless to me.”
LIP,“...Are meaningless to me.”
LIP (CONT’D),Now this... “Falling in love with you was the easiest thing I have ever done.”
TAILOR,“Falling in love with you was the easiest thing...”
LIP,This is very fucking romantic.
TAILOR,"Nothing matters but you. I am the luckiest man alive, and every moment I am without you, I realize this."
TAILOR (CONT’D),"I loved you the day I met you, I love you today..."
DR. SHIRLEY,"Is it okay if I say, “P.S., kiss the kids”?"
LIP,A P.S.?
TAILOR,"Yeah, at the end."
DR. SHIRLEY,That’s like clanging a cowbell at the end of Shostakovich’s 7th.
TAILOR,So it’s okay?
LIP,"It’s perfect, Tony."
LIP,"That guy looks just like you, Doc."
POLICEMAN #1,He does?
POLICEMAN #1,Size-wise.
LIP,"Go in and try it on. What, you always gotta wear a tux on stage? Mix it up a little."
POLICEMAN #2,"May I help you, sir?"
LIP,We want to try on that suit in the window.
POLICEMAN #2,Of course.
LIP,"Dressing room’s in the back, sir."
POLICEMAN #1,Thanks. I’ll just be a moment.
LIP,Take your time. I’ll check out some ties for ya.
POLICEMAN #1,"Uh, excuse me, you’re not allowed to try that on."
LIP,I beg your pardon?
POLICEMAN #1,"If you would like to purchase it first, we’ll be happy to tailor it to your needs."
LIP,Yeah...
POLICEMAN #1,I got a call about Dr. Shirley.
LIP,Come on...
LIP (CONT’D),This is him.
DR. SHIRLEY,"Can you give the guy a towel, for Chrissakes?"
LIP,You a lawyer?
DR. SHIRLEY,No.
LIP,Well you should call one. We’re taking your Auntie in.
DR. SHIRLEY,For what?
LIP,Manager caught him and the other guy...
DR. SHIRLEY,"Can’t we get the cuffs off him, let him put his pants on?"
LIP,Sure we can. But we ain’t.
DR. SHIRLEY,"Look, we’re out of here in the morning, you’ll never see us again. There’s gotta be a way to work this out."
LIP,"What if, uh, you let him go, and I give you something to thank you?"
DR. SHIRLEY,You bribing us?
LIP,"No, no... a thank you."
DR. SHIRLEY,What kind of thank you?
MAN’S VOICE (O.S.),Like... a donation to the police force. To you guys. Whatever you want.
LIP,You like suits?
WISEGUY #1,"How about, as a thank you--a donation--I buy you guys each a suit? You get dressed up nice, take your wives out to dinner. Guys like you, you deserve it."
DOMINIC,"They were wrong for the way they treated me, and you rewarded them."
LIP (O.S.),I was hired to make sure you get from one show to the next. How I do it shouldn’t matter to you.
DOMINIC,I just wish you hadn’t paid them off.
DOMINIC (CONT’D),"I did what I had to do. You know, if this got out it would kill your career."
LIP,"Okay, Tony, quit your phony altruism and concern for my career."
DOMINIC,What the hell does that mean?
LIP,"You were only thinking about yourself back there, because you know if I miss a show, it comes out of your pocket."
DOMINIC,"Of course I don’t want you to miss a show, you ungrateful bastard! You think I’m doing this for my health?! Tonight I saved your ass, so show a little appreciation. Besides, I told you never to go nowhere without me!"
WISEGUY #1,I assumed you would want this to be the exception.
DR. SHIRLEY (O.S.),Should I try to find you some make- up or somethin’ before the show?
LIP,I’m fine.
DR. SHIRLEY,You sure?
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),I said I’m fine.
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),Tony Lip!
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),Dominic. The hell you doin’ here?
LIP,Brooklyn sent us down to take care of a few things.
LIP (CONT’D),Who’s the eggplant?
DR. SHIRLEY,I’m working for him.
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),What’d you lose a bet?
LIP,"What’s wrong with you? You need work, you come to me! I’ll always find work for you. Matter of fact, I can use you this week. Gotta hit a few joints, straighten some people out--you’ll make some real money."
LIP,I’m making money.
DR. SHIRLEY,"Whatever he’s paying you, I’ll double it."
LIP,This isn’t the place to talk about it.
DR. SHIRLEY,Meet me in the bar at eight o’clock sharp. Forget this guy.
LIP,I just called his room. He’ll be down in a minute.
DR. SHIRLEY,Where are you going?
LIP,Oh. Hey. Just... downstairs. For a drink.
DR. SHIRLEY,"To meet your friend, Dominic?"
DR. SHIRLEY,"Before you decide whether or not to take him up on the job offer, I think we should have a word."
DOLORES,"Tony, I think you’re doing a wonderful job."
LYNN,"So I would like to formally offer you the position of my road manager. With the title comes more responsibility and, of course, there will be a raise in pay."
DOLORES,"No, thanks."
LOUIE,"You and me, we agreed on a hundred and twenty-five a week, plus expenses. That’s our deal. I ain’t goin’ nowhere, Doc. I’m just goin’ down to tell ‘em."
RUDY,Tony...
JOHNNY,Sorry about last night.
RUDY,Don’t sweat it. I been workin’ nightclubs in the city my whole life...I know it’s a complicated world.
JOHNNY,"So, how’d you learn how to play so good, Doc?"
RUDY,"My mother. She taught me how to play on an old spinet. Soon as I could walk, we’d travel around the Florida panhandle and I’d put on little shows in parishes and halls. A man who had seen me play arranged for me to study at the Leningrad Conservatory of Music."
FRANCES,So that’s where they taught you all them songs you play?
JOHNNY,"Actually, I was trained to play classical music. Brahms, Franz Liszt, Chopin--it’s all I ever wanted to play."
--THE DON SHIRLEY TRIO PERFORMING AT A MEDIUM-SIZE CONCERT,"But I was persuaded by my record company to pursue a career in popular music instead. They told me audiences would never accept a black pianist on the classical stage. Wanted to turn me into just another “colored entertainer.” You know, the guy who smokes while he’s playing, who puts a glass of whisky on the piano and then gets mad when he’s not respected like Arthur Rubinstein. Well, you don’t see Arthur Rubenstein smoking and putting a drink on his piano."
DR. SHIRLEY,"Personally, if you stuck to that classic stuff I think it would’ve been a big mistake."
--SHIRLEY’S CADILLAC DRIVES THROUGH A RURAL LANDSCAPE DUSTED,A mistake? Performing the music I trained my entire life to play?
--DOLORES AND THE KIDS DECORATE A CHRISTMAS TREE. SHE PLUGS,"Trained? What are you, a seal? Anyone can sound like Beethoven or Joe Pan or them other guys you said. But your music, what you do, only you can do, and nobody can train for that."
--A MAN IN A WHITE TUXEDO INTRODUCES DON SHIRLEY TO A SMALL,"Thank you, Tony."
TUXEDO MAN,But...not everyone can play Chopin...not the way I can.
LIP,"“...The trees have shed their leafy clothing and the colors have faded to grays and browns, but my heart bursts with reds and blues and greens from the love I hold inside for you...”"
LIP STEPS ON IT. THE LIGHTS FROM THE TAILING VEHICLE GET,"“It’s getting colder as we travel, but the country is still beautiful."
LIP (CONT’D),He’s so expressive.
PATROLMAN #1,"“We’ve only a few more shows before our Christmas concert in Birmingham, Alabama on the 23rd. I will count the hours, minutes, and seconds until you are in my arms. I love and miss you more than I can explain. Tony. P.S.--Kiss the kids.”"
LIP,"Gotta admit, Lip’s letters--they’re not bad."
PATROLMAN #1,"Well, it’s in the family. They say we had a great, great, great grandfather helped Da Vinci with the Sixteen Chapel."
LIP,You mean Michelangelo.
PATROLMAN #1,"Right. And that’s a true story, right, Pop?"
PATROLMAN #1 (CONT’D),What the hell’s that got to do with writin’ letters?
LIP,"I’m just sayin’, we’re an arty family."
PATROLMAN #1,"John, I want a letter."
LIP,"Yeah, soon as you make a meal..."
PATROLMAN #1,HALL.
LIP,Tony...
PATROLMAN #1,WITH SNOW.
LIP,"IT IN, THE TREE LIGHTS UP."
PATROLMAN #2,GATHERING.
PATROLMAN #1,Let’s give a fine Louisiana welcome to Don Shirley and the Don Shirley Trio!
PATROLMAN #2,Your mother’s ass...
PATROLMAN #1,"CLOSER AND BRIGHTER, ILLUMINATING THE BACKSEAT."
LIP,‘Hell’s this guy doin’?
PATROLMAN #1,License and papers?
LIP,Glad to see you guys. I’m a little lost.
PATROLMAN #1,Step out of the car.
"LIP SLAMS PATROLMAN #1 WITH AN UPPERCUT, DROPPING HIM LIKE A",In the rain? What I do?
POLICEMAN #2,Out of the car.
DR. SHIRLEY,Why you on this road?
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),"I told you, I had to detour and I’m lost. We’re not from around here."
PATROLMAN #1,"No, you ain’t. So I’m gonna ask you again... what the hell you doin’ out here?"
DR. SHIRLEY,And why you driving him?
PATROLMAN #1,He’s my boss.
DR. SHIRLEY,He can’t be out here at night. This is a sundown town.
PATROLMAN #2,What’s that mean?
POLICE CHIEF,Get him out of the car. Check his I.D.
PATROLMAN #1,"Come on, it’s pouring."
DR. SHIRLEY,I can just get it through the window.
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),Get him out the goddamn car!
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),Out.
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),What’s this last name say?
LIP,Vallelonga.
DR. SHIRLEY,‘Hell kind of name is that?
PATROLMAN #2,Italian.
PATROLMAN #2 (CONT’D),"Oh, now I get it. That’s why you driving this boy around... you half a nigger yourself."
POLICE CHIEF,STONE.
POLICE CHIEF (CONT’D),"Hands in the air, now!"
POLICE CHIEF (CONT’D),Excuse me!
POLICE CHIEF (CONT’D),"Excuse me, sirs. I quite understand why my associate is being held, but what exactly am I being charged with?"
POLICE CHIEF (CONT’D),You seem like reasonable men--can you let me out so we might discuss the situation please?
PATROLMAN #1,"Put the apple butter away, boy--you ain’t goin’ nowhere no time soon."
POLICE CHIEF,You cannot hold me without cause!
PATROLMAN #1 (O.S.),I got cause. ‘Cause you let the sun set on your black ass!
POLICE CHIEF (O.S.),"I want to speak to a lawyer, I want my phone call! This is a flagrant violation of my rights! I demand my phone call immediately!"
LIP,He does have...rights.
LIP,Give the negra his goddamn call.
DR. SHIRLEY,You know a lawyer? Call him.
LIP,"As my mother always said, “What kind of brand new fool are you?!”"
DR. SHIRLEY,"Look out there, Tony. Take a good look at the officer you hit."
LIP,Look at him.
DR. SHIRLEY,"He’s having a grand old time, chatting up his pals, having a nice cup of coffee. And where are you? In here. With me. Who did nothing. Yet I’m the one who’s paying the price. I’m the one who’s going to miss the Birmingham show."
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),"Hey, I’m losin’ a lot of money, too, if you don’t play Birmingham."
LIP,So your little temper tantrum...was it worth it?
DR. SHIRLEY,"You don’t win with violence, Tony, you win when you maintain your dignity. Dignity always prevails. And tonight, because of you, we did not."
LIP,Mayersville Po-lice.
DR. SHIRLEY,"No, sir. Not me, sir. Yes, sir, he’s right here, sir."
LIP,What?
DR. SHIRLEY,Chief Pratt--who’s this?
LIP,Bull-oney.
DR. SHIRLEY,"Okay, yes, now I hear it, Governor. I’m sorry. Yes, of course I recognize your voice."
LIP,"I-I’m sorry, you sayin’ the boy we got locked up called who, sir?"
DR. SHIRLEY,And he called you?
LIP,But an officer was assaulted in the line of...
DR. SHIRLEY,"No, no, I don’t want no National Guard down here, neither, sir."
LIP,"Yes, Governor, immediately. And good night to you and the missus."
LIP (CONT’D),Let ‘em go.
DR. SHIRLEY,What?!
DR. SHIRLEY,"Cut ‘em loose, goddamnit!"
LIP,But that dago-wop hit me!
DR. SHIRLEY,Now!
LIP,Who the hell’d you call?
DR. SHIRLEY,Bobby Kennedy just saved our asses! Maddon...How great is that?!
LIP,It’s not great--it’s not great at all--it’s humiliating.
DR. SHIRLEY,‘The hell you talking about? We were screwed and now we ain’t.
LIP,And I just put the Attorney General of the United States in an incredibly awkward position.
DR. SHIRLEY,So what? That’s what the guy gets paid for. What else he got to do?
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),"That man and his brother are trying to change this country--that’s what else he’s got to do! Now he thinks I’m garbage. Calling from some backwoods swamp jail, asking if he can help attenuate assault charges... who does that? Garbage, that’s who."
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),You shouldn’t have hit him!
LIP,"I didn’t like the way he was treating you, making you stand out in the rain."
DR. SHIRLEY,"Please. You hit him because of what he called you. I’ve had to listen to that kind of talk my entire life, you should be able to take it for one night."
LIP,"What, I can’t get mad when he says that stuff ‘cause I’m not black? Christ, I’m blacker than you."
DR. SHIRLEY,You’re blacker than me?
LIP,"You don’t know shit about your own people! What they eat, how they talk, how they live--you don’t even know who Lil’ Richard is!"
LIP (CONT’D),"So knowing who Little Richard is makes you blacker than me? I wish you could hear yourself sometimes, Tony--you wouldn’t talk as much."
DR. SHIRLEY,"Bullshit! I know exactly who I am. I’m the guy who’s lived on the same block in the same Bronx my entire life, with my mother and father and my brother, and now my wife and kids. That’s it--that’s who I am. I’m the asshole who’s gotta hustle every goddamn day to put food on my table. You? Mr. Big Shot? You travel around the world and live on top of a castle and do concerts for rich people! I live on the streets, you sit on a throne--so yeah, my world is way more blacker than yours!"
LIP,Pull over.
DR. SHIRLEY,What?
GRAHAM KINDELL,Pull! Over!
DR. SHIRLEY,I ain’t pullin’ over!
GRAHAM KINDELL,STOP THE CAR!
GRAHAM KINDELL,What are you doin’?!
DR. SHIRLEY,Get back in the car!
GRAHAM KINDELL,"Yes, I live in a castle! Alone. And rich white folks let me play piano for them, because it makes them feel cultured. But when I walk off that stage I go right back to being another nigger to them--because that is their true culture. And I suffer that slight alone, because I’m not accepted by my own people, because I’m not like them either! So if I’m not black enough, and I’m not white enough, and I’m not man enough, what am I?!"
LIP,I need sleep.
GRAHAM KINDELL,"Okay, I’ll pull over at the next place we see and I’ll sneak you into my room."
LIP,No. No. I refuse to stay at an establishment that doesn’t want me.
DR. SHIRLEY,Okay.
GEORGE,You realize you’re going to be home before that letter gets there?
LIP,"Yeah, I was gonna just bring it with me. Save on stamps."
BIRMINGHAM WAITER,"Give it here, I’ll fix it."
OLEG,"No offense, Doc, but I think I got the hang of it."
OLEG (CONT’D),"“Dear Dolores, sometimes you remind me of a house.”"
GEORGE,”A house with beautiful lights on it where everyone inside is happy.”
LIP,"Yeah, you got it."
OLEG,Doc...
OLEG (CONT’D),Yes?
OLEG (CONT’D),Thanks for helping me with the letters--you’re really good at writin’ ‘em.
LIP,Maybe when you get home you should write one to your brother?
DR. SHIRLEY,He knows where I am if he wants to reconnect.
LIP,"Don’t wait for him, Doc. This I know...the world’s full of lonely people afraid to make the first move."
MAITRE D’,"You know, something’s been eating at me the whole trip."
GRAHAM KINDELL,Hmmm?
LIP,That Tittsburgh was a real disappointment. I didn’t notice any difference at all.
GRAHAM KINDELL,"Good night, Tony."
DR. SHIRLEY,"Welcome, Mr. Shirley! Graham Kindell, I’m the general manager. So nice to meet y’all!"
LIP,"Thank you, Mr. Kindell. This is Tony Vallelonga."
GRAHAM KINDELL,"Pleasure, Tony. Right this way."
LIP,If you need anything--anything t’all--you let me know.
GRAHAM KINDELL,Thank you.
DR. SHIRLEY,Here you are. We have about an hour before show time. Any questions?
GRAHAM KINDELL,Where’s the restaurant?
LIP,"Continue down the hall, Tony, to the right, across the lobby."
LIP (CONT’D),We’ve got an hour. I’m starving.
DR. SHIRLEY,Go ahead. I’ll meet you there.
GRAHAM KINDELL,Tony!
GRAHAM KINDELL,Shirley’ll be here in a minute.
LIP,"Cocktails, gentlemen?"
GRAHAM KINDELL,Three shots vodka.
LIP,Last show. Cold war over. Time for truce.
GRAHAM KINDELL,Is Shirley in his dressing room?
LIP,More like a broom closet. I don’t understand why he puts up with this shit.
GRAHAM KINDELL,"Six years ago, 1956, Nat King Cole was invited to perform at Municipal Auditorium right here in Birmingham. Mr. Cole was very first negro asked to play at a white establishment in this city."
GRAHAM KINDELL (CONT’D),"Soon as Mr. Cole started playing, a group of men attacked him for playing white people’s music. Pulled him off stage and beat him badly."
GRAHAM KINDELL (CONT’D),You asked once why Dr. Shirley does this? I tell you. Because there is no genius without courage.
LIP,What’s the problem?
GRAHAM KINDELL,This gentleman’s saying I can’t dine here.
DR. SHIRLEY (O.S.),"No, you don’t understand, this guy’s playing here tonight--he’s the main event."
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),I’m sorry. It’s the policy of the restaurant.
LIP,Everything all right?
GRAHAM KINDELL,"No, it’s not all right. Dr. Shirley’s being told he can’t eat here."
GRAHAM KINDELL (CONT’D),"I apologize, but these are... long- standing traditions. I’m sure you understand."
GRAHAM KINDELL (CONT’D),"No. I don’t. In 45 minutes I’ll be entertaining your guests up on that stage, but I can’t eat here?"
DR. SHIRLEY,"Wait a minute. You’re tellin’ me the bozos in his band, and the shlubs that came to see him play can eat here, but the star can’t?"
ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER,I’m afraid not.
LIP,Well he’s gotta eat. Can you at least bring him food from the restaurant to his dressing room?
ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER,Of course. We’ll be happy to send him anything he would like.
DR. SHIRLEY,"John, show him a menu."
ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER,No. I’m not eating in a dressing room.
DR. SHIRLEY,"Okay... if you’d prefer, there’s a very popular establishment right down the road--the Orange Bird-- they’ll be happy to feed you."
ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER,"Food’s probably better there anyway --the dinner rolls here are like rocks. Come on, we can be back in 45 minutes."
LIP,"Doc, it’s the last show. Let’s just get through this and we can go home and get away from all these assholes."
ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER,No. Not this time. I’m eating in this room or I’m not playing.
DR. SHIRLEY,May I have a word with you?
LIP,"Mr. Villanueva, you have to talk sense to Mr. Shirley. Please explain that we’re not insulting him personally, this is just the way things are done down here."
ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER,"Yeah, well he ain’t from down here."
LIP,Just ask him to be reasonable. I have 400 guests out there who expect to be entertained tonight.
ORANGE BIRD BARTENDER,And Dr. Shirley expects to eat tonight. Why can’t you just make an exception this one time?
DR. SHIRLEY,"Lemme tell you a story. You ever hear of the Boston Celtics basketball club? Those boys came through here a couple years ago on a barnstorming tour. Now, seeing as they were World Champions of the league and all, we was tickled to have ‘em eat here and we rolled out the welcome wagon. So you know what table their big coon ate at that night?"
LIP,No.
DR. SHIRLEY,I don’t either. But it wasn’t one of ours.
LIP,Now let’s cut the bullshit. Tell me what it’s gonn’ take.
DR. SHIRLEY,Say one hundred dollars and you get your boy to play?
LIP,You think you can buy me?
DR. SHIRLEY,"All do respect, sir, but you wouldn’t be doing a job like this if you couldn’t be bought."
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),Stop!
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),"It’s all right, Tony. I’ll play... if you want me to."
LIP,"Nah, let’s get the fuck outta here."
LIP,"Don, don’t do this!"
DR. SHIRLEY,"We have a contract, and I know you’re the kind of man that honors a contract!"
LIP,"You got a show to do, mister!"
STATE TROOPER,You hungry?
LIP,You a cop?
DR. SHIRLEY,I look Irish?
STATE TROOPER,"What you want, baby?"
STATE TROOPER,"Two Cutty’s, neat."
NEWSCASTER (V.O.),Comin’ up.
LIP,"Whatever your specialty is, we’ll take it."
DR. SHIRLEY,Two orange birds!
LIP,"I like what you did back there, Doc. You stood up for yourself. It’s like your friend the President says -- “Don’t ask what your country can do for you, ask what you can do for yourself.”"
CLOSE ON - A NEEDLE AS IT DROPS ONTO THE GROOVES OF A,"So, darlin’, what you do, all dressed up like that?"
“HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS” FROM THE FRANK,Nothing important.
SINATRA (V.O.),He’s only the greatest piano player in the world.
DR. SHIRLEY (O.S.),That right? You good?
LIP,"Don’t be shy, Doc. Tell her who you are."
DR. SHIRLEY,Don’t tell me nothin’--show me.
LIP,"If we leave right now, I think you can make it."
DR. SHIRLEY,Make what?
LIP,Christmas Eve.
JOHNNY,Don’t ever flash a wad of cash in a bar.
DOLORES,I knew you had a gun!
LIP,This could get bad.
AMIT,"Yes, it’s a shame we don’t have something to protect us on our journey."
DR. SHIRLEY,"Why don’t you put your lucky rock up on the dash, Tony?"
AMIT,Thank you. I feel safer already.
DR. SHIRLEY,"You’re a real prick, you know that?"
AMIT,"Doc, my eyes are stingin’, I might need to pull over."
JOHNNY,"Keep going as long as you can, Tony."
LIP,Shit...
JOHNNY,What are you doing out here?
LIP,We’re trying to get to New York.
JOHNNY,"Is there a problem, Officer?"
LIP,Yeah. I noticed your car was tilting to the left. Looks like your back tire’s flat.
JOHNNY,"Okay... be careful, gentlemen. Merry Christmas."
LOUIE,"“Weather advisory warning this Christmas Eve, as a major snowstorm is hitting the eastern seaboard with the severest weather in eastern Pennsylvania, northern New Jersey and the five boroughs. Travelers are advised to stay off the Jersey Turnpike, as well as the bridges and tunnels leading into New York		 City, due to possible road closures...”"
RUDY,That’s it. I’m pulling us into the next motel.
LIP,"Keep going, Tony, you can make it."
RUDY,"I can’t keep my eyes open, Doc--I’m gettin’ hytnotized by the snow. I think my brain’s gonna explode."
DOLORES,SPINNING ALBUM...
FRAN,SINATRA CHRISTMAS ALBUM plays on a record player.
JOHNNY,“Have yourself a merry little Christmas...”
LIP,"Tony, wake up!"
PAWN GUY,"What... Doc, whadja’ do?"
LIP,You’re home. Go inside.
PAWN GUY,"Doc, why don’t you come up, meet my family...?"
LIP,"Merry Christmas, Tony."
JOHNNY,"Doc, wait up! Hey..."
JOHNNY (CONT’D),"Hey, look who it is--Shakespeare’s home!"
LIP,You hungry?
DR. SHIRLEY,You kiddin’? I’m starving.
JOHNNY,"Welcome home, Dr. Shirley."
DR. SHIRLEY,"Thank you, Amit."
DR. SHIRLEY (CONT’D),"I turned down your bed, sir. Will you be needing anything else?"
DOLORES,"No, thank you. Go home to your family."
AMIT,"Thank you, Doctor. Merry Christmas."
JOHNNY,"Tony, s’matter with you? You haven’t said a word."
LIP,"Yeah, sorry, just tired. Long trip.(under breath, to Johnny)You take care of that thing?"
