TOLLER (V.O.),"I have decided to keep a journal. Not in a word program or a digital file, but in longhand, writing every word out so that every inflection of penmanship is recorded, every word chosen, scratched out, revised to set down all my thoughts..."
TOLLER (V.O.),"I will keep this diary for one year, twelve months and at the end of that time it will be destroyed. Shredded, then burnt. The experiment will be over."
TOLLER,“What is thy only comfort in life and death?”
PARISHONERS,"“That I with body and soul, both in life and death, am not my own but belong unto my faithful Savior Jesus Christ, who with his precious blood hath fully satisfied for all my sins...”"
TOLLER (V.O.),"These thoughts and recollections are not so different from those I confide to God every morning, when it is possible, when he is listening..."
TOLLER (V.O.),"...This journal is a form of speaking, of communication from one to the other, a communication which can be achieved simply and in repose without prostration or abnegation. It is a form of prayer."
ELDER,There is a leak in the men’s restroom.
TOLLER,I fixed it.
ELDER,I was just there. It’s still leaking. Same place. Under the hot faucet.
TOLLER,Did you check the women’s?
ELDER,The women’s is fine. Do you want me to call the plumber from Abundant Life?
TOLLER,Let me have a go at it again. I don’t like to be always asking Abundant Life for little costs here and there.
ELDER,They don’t mind. That’s what they’re there for. You are totally within your budget.
TOLLER,Still...
ELDER,Have you posted the sermon?
TOLLER,I did it this morning.
TOLLER,Yes?
MARY,Come in.
TOLLER,Reverend?
MARY,"Come in. Mary, right?"
TOLLER,Mary Mensana.
MARY,Nice to see you again.
ELDER,I wanted to talk...
TOLLER,I’ll be right back.
MARY,What is it?
TOLLER,"I wonder if you could speak with Michael, my husband."
MARY,Of course. Ask him to come in.
TOLLER,Not now. He’s got to go to Home Depot and work. He’s filling in.
MARY,"Mary, what is it?"
TOLLER,I’m worried about him.
MARY,He’s involved with the Green planet movement.
TOLLER,"He was in jail in Canada. He got out a couple of weeks ago. He just sits at home. He doesn’t go out. I got him to fill out a temp form for Home Depot, so that’s good."
MARY,Are you sure you wouldn’t rather go to Abundant Life? They have a staff of counsellors who are much more experienced--
TOLLER,"No, he won’t see them. He says they are more like a company than a church. He said he’d talk to you."
TOLLER,Of course. Tomorrow?
MARY,After lunchtime.
TOLLER,I’ll come to you.
MARY,I’ll need your address.
TOLLER (V.O.),Can you tell me any more?
TOLLER (V.O.),He applied for Compassionate Release when he found out. He was at Ft. Providence. They let him out two weeks ago.
TOLLER (V.O.),Found out what?
MARY,That I was pregnant.
MICHAEL,He says it’s wrong to bring a child into this world.
MARY,He wants to kill my baby.
TOLLER,"I assisted Sunday the youth group at Abundant Life. The young people were so excited, so full of life. They were open, they welcome communion. Maybe I shouldn’t care about whether people like me? Did Jesus worry about being liked?"
MARY,I look at the lines I last wrote with disdain. Twelve months? Can I keep up an exercise that long? I read these words and see not truth but pride.
TOLLER,I wish I had not used the word pride. But I cannot cross it out. If only I could pray.
MICHAEL,Thanks for coming.
TOLLER,Our honeymoon. A bike honeymoon.
MICHAEL,Ireland.
TOLLER,Thanks for coming. Would you like some coffee?
MICHAEL,"Yes, but..."
TOLLER,I think we have some tea.
MICHAEL,That would be better.
MICHAEL,I don’t know why Mary...
TOLLER,No reason to apologize. You’ve been in Canada?
MICHAEL,"Ft. Providence. That is in the Mackenzie Delta, way to the north."
TOLLER,"Beautiful country, I imagine."
MICHAEL,It is.
MICHAEL,Mary says things have gotten you down.
MICHAEL,"“Things?” You could say that, yes."
MICHAEL,Mary is pregnant.
TOLLER (V.O.),I noticed. How far along is she?
MICHAEL,"Twenty weeks. How old are you, Reverend?"
MICHAEL,Forty-two.
TOLLER,Thirty-five.
MICHAEL,That’s how old our child will be in 2050. Five years older than I am now. You’ll be seventy-seven. Do you know what the world will be like in 2050? TOLLER It’s hard to imagine.
TOLLER,You think?
MICHAEL,The world is changing fast. Right in front of us. One third of the natural world has been destroyed in your lifetime. The earth’s temperature will be three degrees centigrade higher. Four is the threshold.
TOLLER,"...“severe, widespread, and irreversible impacts”--when scientists use words like that--the National Center of Atmospheric Research, Lawrence Livermore, the Potsdam Institute..."
MICHAEL,"He went on for some time like that. By 2050 sea levels two feet higher on the East Coast. Low lying areas underwater across the world. Bangladesh, twenty percent loss of land mass. Central Africa, fifty percent reduction in crops due to drought. The western reservoirs dried up. Climate change refugees. Epidemics. Extreme weather."
TOLLER,...the bad times will begin. From that point everything moves very quickly. The social structure will not bear the stress of multiple crises. Opportunistic diseases. Anarchy. Martial law. The tipping point. This isn’t some distant future. You will live to see this. My children will experience this...unlivability. And the behavior it causes...this...
MICHAEL,I thought something could be done. I thought people would listen.
MICHAEL,Mary said you would be willing to talk to me?
TOLLER,Yes.
TOLLER,Why is that?
TOLLER,I respect you. I respect what you’ve... been through.
MICHAEL,Do you have thoughts of harming yourself?
TOLLER,No. Did Mary say that?
MICHAEL,"No, she didn’t."
TOLLER,I’m not worried for myself. This world will be what it is.
TOLLER,"But how can you sanction bringing a girl, for argument’s sake let’s say my child is a girl, a child full of hope and naive belief into a world...when that little girl grows to be a young woman and looks you in the eyes and says, ‘You knew all along, didn’t you?’ What do you say then?"
MICHAEL,You say what a father has always said. “I love you without qualification.”
TOLLER,There is something growing inside Mary. Something as surely alive as a tree or an endangered species. Something filled with nature’s beauty. You speak of “sanctioning” this birth-- is it really your decision? Do you have that right? What does Mary think?
MICHAEL,It is her decision?
TOLLER (V.O.),Yes.
MICHAEL,You’ve told her that?
TOLLER,So it is not about the child. Or about Mary. It is about you and your despair. Your lack of hope.
MICHAEL,"Throughout history humans have woken up in the dead of night, confronted by blackness. The sense that life is without meaning. The Suffering Unto Death."
TOLLER,But this is something new.
MICHAEL,"Man’s achievements have brought him to a great place where life as we know it may cease in the foreseeable future. That is new. Our powerlessness. The blackness is not. Because we are people of science we like to solve things. We want rational responses. If humankind can’t overcome its immediate interests to ensure its survival, that requires a rational response. And that response is despair."
MICHAEL,Do you believe there is existence apart from this...?
TOLLER,Yes.
MICHAEL,Before us? After us?
TOLLER,Yeah.
MICHAEL,"I felt like I was Jacob wrestling all night long with the angel. Fighting in the grasp. Every sentence, every question, every response a mortal struggle. Fighting for existence itself. It was exhilarating."
TOLLER,"...Do you believe in martyrdom, Reverend?"
TOLLER,I’m not sure what you mean.
TOLLER,"The Saints of God, the early Christians who would not renounce their faith, the missionaries attacked in the jungle--do you believe they died for a purpose?"
MICHAEL,I do.
TOLLER,Every week activists are killed protecting the environment. One hundred and seventeen last year. For their beliefs.
MICHAEL,"José Cláudio Ribeiro da Silva and his wife Maria were gunned down in 2011 in the Amazon. They protested free cutting of the rain forest. Dorothy Stang, 2005, a nun from Ohio. What was the purpose of their deaths? In 2010 the IPCC predicted that if dramatic action was not taken by 2015, environmental collapse would be irreversible. Nothing was done. It’s now 2017."
TOLLER,You said you respected me. What I’d gone through.
MICHAEL,Yes.
TOLLER,You know my story?
TOLLER,You were a chaplain.
MICHAEL,"My father taught at VMI. I encouraged my son to enlist. It was the family tradition. Like his father, his grandfather. Patriotic tradition. My wife was very opposed. But he enlisted against her wishes."
TOLLER,Six months later he was killed in Iraq. There was no moral justification for this conflict. My wife could not live with me after that. Who could blame her? I left the military. Rev Jeffers at Abundant Life Church heard about my situation. They offered me a position at First Reformed. And here I am.
MICHAEL,"Michael, whatever despair you feel about bringing a child into this world cannot equal the despair of taking a child out of it."
TOLLER,What was his name? Your son?
MICHAEL,Joseph.
TOLLER,That’s right.
TOLLER,The boy thrown in the well.
MICHAEL,And you were able to go on?
TOLLER,The Old Calvinists used to preach a doctrine called the “Unforgiveable Sin.” You don’t hear about it any more. It was the sin against the Holy Spirit. It was the sin against Hope. The only sin that lies beyond forgiveness.
MICHAEL,It comes down to choice. We choose hope or despair. We cannot avoid choosing. We are not free to not decide. It’s what we truly are. Courage is the solution to despair.
TOLLER,Reason offers no answers. We cannot be certain what the future holds. We must choose despite uncertainty.
MICHAEL,Wisdom is the ability to hold two contradictory thoughts in your mind simultaneously. Hope and despair. A life without despair is a life without hope. Holding those ideas in your head together is life. Itself.
TOLLER (V.O.),"Are you a drinking man, Reverend?"
TOLLER (V.O.),It doesn’t help.
TOLLER (V.O.),"No, I suppose not."
TOLLER (V.O.),I’ll stay as long as you need me. There’s no place I need to be.
TOLLER,Can God forgive us? For what we have done to this world?
TOLLER,"I don’t know. Who can know the mind of God? Perhaps we are a way station. But we can choose. To live the righteous life, to believe, to forgive. Grace covers us all."
TOLLER,We will speak again. Promise me that.
MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN,I won’t leave until you promise.
TOLLER,Okay.
TOLLER,Tomorrow at this time. After lunch.
TOLLER,Are you working tomorrow?
TOLLER,I haven’t heard.
MIDLE-AGED MAN,So it’s a plan then. Tomorrow at this time.
TOLLER,Yes. It’s a plan.
MIDLE-AGED MAN,"I went over everything that was said, what should have been said, what could have been said differently, what could have been said better."
TOLLER,Despair is a form of pride. “I know that nothing can change and I know there is no hope.” Merton wrote about this.
“WASHED IN THE BLOOD”,Despair is a development of pride so great that it chooses one’s certitude rather than admit God is more creative than we are. Perhaps it’s better I didn’t say that to him.
ESTHER,Who am I to talk about pride?
ESTHER,"...completed in 1765 in a style we now call Dutch Colonial by settlers in this region with local field stones and timber, First Reformed took seven years to build."
TOLLER,The Vei Plancks were one of the founding families. Effie’s tombstone dates from 1787.
ESTHER,"The church was partially rebuilt in 1837 following a fire. This section was preserved. Beside the Continental Army flag, if you look closely, are two bullet holes fired during what was called the Skirmish of Snowbridge."
TOLLER,Do you still have services?
ESTHER,"Oh yes, Sunday services are each week at 10 am. First Reformed is the third oldest church in continuous operation in New York State. In a month we will celebrate our two hundred fiftieth anniversary."
TOLLER,"...here are examples of the original church chinaware brought over from the Netherlands. And the first chalice. On the lower shelf are souvenirs which are for sale. Key rings, pens, postcards, caps and T shirts, although we only have the shirts in size S. We’re waiting for more to come in."
ESTHER,Try it on. One size fits all.
TOLLER,The pulpit was donated by William Mercer in 1879. The church organ which unfortunately is not working at this time was manufactured by A.G. Hill in England.
ESTHER,Did you hear the one about the Choir Mistress and the Minister?
TOLLER,"No, I haven’t."
ESTHER,She chased him around the church and caught him by the organ.
1ST SECRETARY,I hadn’t heard that one.
JEFFERS,"“Have you been to Jesus for the cleansing pow’r, Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?”."
JEFFERS,Very good. Take five.
TOLLER,A penny for your thoughts.
JEFFERS,Joel wanted me to come by.
TOLLER,"Nothing serious, I hope."
JEFFERS,I assume not.
TOLLER,Want to have lunch?
JEFFERS,"I’ve got something after, but, well sure, why not?"
TOLLER,Remember that?
JEFFERS,What?
TOLLER,When everything was ahead of you.
JEFFERS,Try to tell them that.
JEFFERS,See you then.
TOLLER,“In the garden.”
JEFFERS,"Reverend Toller, go right in. He’s expecting you."
TOLLER,"Rev. Toller. Good, sit down."
JEFFERS,"Matt, make those two changes."
TOLLER,"Need water, anything?"
JEFFERS,How are things at First Reformed?
TOLLER,"Good. Busy. You know how it is. You do one thing, then the next, then it’s Sunday again."
JEFFERS,I wanted to ask about the 250th Reconsecration. It’s right around the corner.
TOLLER,Eight weeks.
JEFFERS,How’s it coming?
TOLLER,"The invitations are being handled by your office. We don’t have that many seats. Your staff, the Elders and Deacons, ecumenical representatives, the Mayor, the Governor--there’s no overflow room. The sanctuary, that’s it."
JEFFERS,We’ll simulcast the ceremony here in the main hall. That’s five thousand seats. Have the reception afterward in the rotunda. Is the organ fixed?
TOLLER,They’re waiting on parts. It’s a bigger deal than they thought.
JEFFERS,Can’t have a reconsecration without an organ.
ESTHER,“A Mighty Fortress is Our God.” Do you know Martin Luther wrote that sitting in the outhouse. “A Mighty”...
TOLLER,“Fortress”...
ESTHER,“Is our God.”
TOLLER,I think every seminarian knows that story.
ESTHER,Can’t get the image out of my mind. Every time we play that song I look at the congregation and know everybody is thinking the same thing.
TOLLER,Prepared your remarks yet?
ESTHER,Not yet.
TOLLER,"The memorial program comes off the press at the end of the month. We’re working on my address. When we have a draft I want to run it by you. Make sure everything is right. Ed Balq would like to meet with us, have a coffee."
ESTHER,Balq Industries?
TOLLER,"He thinks this is a real opportunity. An important moment in the history of the church, the county. There’ll be national media."
ESTHER,Wow.
TOLLER,How are you?
ESTHER,Fine.
TOLLER,"I mean really. It’s been a while since we’ve spoken. Even a pastor needs a pastor. We’re overdue for a talk. Just you, me."
ESTHER,That would be nice.
TOLLER,You should come around more often. There are so many activities you could help with. The young people really like you. Get out of--what do the kids call it? The museum?
TOLLER (V.O.),The souvenir shop. They call it the souvenir shop.
MARY (O.S.),You’re doing a great thing.
TOLLER,Thank you again for the opportunity.
MARY,"No, we thank you."
TOLLER,How was Jeffers?
MARY,He wants me to meet with Ed Balq.
TOLLER,"Balq Industries, Balq Energy, Balq Chicken, Balq Peanuts, Balq whatnots."
MARY,Why?
MARY,It’s all about the 250th Reconsecration. Balq wants to make sure he gets proper credit for underwriting it.
MARY,He should. First Reformed would be a parking lot if it wasn’t for him. Did you see the doctor?
MARY,I made an appointment. There was a holdup with the insurance. The insurance companies make it very hard.
TOLLER,"Well, that’s what they do. You need someone to take care of you."
MARY,"Esther, we tried that. I’m not made for that."
MARY,For what? Love? You’re not made for love?
TOLLER,My marriage was a failure.
MARY,No marriage can survive the loss of a child.
TOLLER,Esther.
MARY,Is that what you think? That what we did together was a sin? That we trangressed?
TOLLER,I don’t believe that. I’ve seen enough real sin to know the difference. Okay?
MARY,Okay. I understand. I care about you. I want you to be happy.
TOLLER,I am happy.
MARY,"Some are called for their gregariousness, some are called for their suffering, others are called for their loneliness. They are called by God because through the vessel of communication they can reach out and hold beating hearts in their hands. They are called because of their all consuming knowledge of the emptiness of all things that only can be filled by the presence of Our Savior."
TOLLER,Reverend Toller?
MARY,Yes. Mary?
TOLLER,It’s me.
MARY,I got your message. About rescheduling.
TOLLER,You must come over. Now.
MARY,Is Michael there?
TOLLER,"No, he’s at work. You must come over. Now."
MARY,Follow me.
TOLLER,"I was looking for some batteries. We were out and I thought there might be some here, you know,"
MARY,I put everything back just as I found it. I wanted you to see it just as it was.
TOLLER (V.O.),An explosive vest.
TOLLER (V.O.),"A suicide vest. Other elements are here. Batteries, detonators, tubes of jelly."
TOLLER (V.O.),He’s been working in the garage. He said he was fixing a motor. I didn’t question him. He’s been so lonely lately I was happy he found something that made him happy.
TOLLER,Did you have any...?
1ST REPAIRMAN,No. No suspicion. Nothing like this.
2ND REPAIRMAN,I can’t believe this.
TOLLER,Does Michael have any hint you know about this?
TOLLER,No.
MARY,When does he come back?
TOLLER,Later tonight. After closing. Ten PM.
MARY,Okay. I will take this. This cannot remain here. I will dispose of it. Don’t let on. Put everything back the way it was.
TOLLER,Are you going to the police?
MARY,"You don’t want that, do you?"
TOLLER,No.
MARY,"It wouldn’t help. It would only make things worse. It does no good to threaten him. Don’t let on you know about this. I will come and see him tomorrow. Somehow tomorrow, in the course of our conversation, I will bring this up."
TOLLER,I’m so frightened.
TOLLER,I don’t think Michael wants to die. I don’t think he wants to abandon his child. He is in torment. But there is an end to torment. He needs support. Are you afraid of him?
SHERIFF,Afraid he might hurt you?
TOLLER,I’m afraid for him.
SHERIFF,"Have other activists been around, called him?"
TOLLER,Nobody. He has no friends. He’s been barely sociable.
SHERIFF,You will stand by him?
TOLLER,Absolutely.
SHERIFF,Discernment intersects with Christian life at every moment. Listening and waiting for God’s wish what action must be taken.
TOLLER,My petty ailments have made me bad tempered. I fight the urge to write down the thoughts which come to my mind.
SHERIFF,The desire to pray itself is a type of prayer. How often we ask for genuine experience when all we really want is emotion. My hand shakes as I write these lines.
TOLLER,I didn’t expect you for another two weeks.
SHERIFF,We got a message from the boss. He said it was a top priority.
MARY,You are having a big event here?
TOLLER,It’s the two hundred fiftieth anniversary of the Church. They are expecting a lot of important people.
MARY,"Mary, this is Reverend Toller. Is Michael there?"
TOLLER,No.
MARY,Do you know where he is?
TOLLER,He’s out.
TOLLER,Did he come home last night?
MARY,Yes. He left without saying anything this morning.
TOLLER,Reverend?
MARY,Yes.
TOLLER,He was up during the night.
MARY,Michael?
LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT,"He had been fighting depression. We were supposed to meet again today. I knew he was in trouble, but I didn’t foresee this."
MARY,Were you in touch with the immediate family?
TOLLER,His wife Mary asked me to meet with him.
MARY,Did she know about your text?
TOLLER (V.O.),No. But she was concerned. We both were concerned.
TOLLER (V.O.),Have you notified her?
TOLLER (V.O.),No.
TOLLER (V.O.),I guess that’s where I’m headed.
TOLLER (V.O.),Can I come along?
ELDER,I knew his father.
TOLLER,What was he like?
ELDER,A businessman. Morbid son of a bitch. I guess it runs in the blood.
TOLLER,Have you told anyone?
TOLLER,"If you find any more...similiar things, just discard them if it’s safe. Bury them, burn them. Michael was troubled but his cause was just. There’s no reason to bring disrepute on that cause."
ELDER,Are you an activist as well?
TOLLER,I share Michael’s beliefs. But I want to live. I want to be a mother. I want to have this child.
CLERK,Do you have family nearby?
TOLLER,My sister. She’s in Buffalo.
JASON,"Have you spoken with your doctor? I’m not sure what medications are permissible during pregnancy but I’m sure he can give you something to relax you, help you sleep."
ROGER,He’d been in the garage?
ROGER,Yes.
CYNTHIA,And said nothing?
ROGER,No.
TOLLER,"This is cut and dried from the police point of view, but it might be good to straighten up his office. Remove his laptop."
JAKE,He left a message for you.
ROGER,Instructions for My Internment
JAKE,I knew.
TOLLER,What?
JEFFERS,He was absent. He was becoming someone I didn’t know. Even before I was pregnant. He was so full of anger.
TOLLER,I stayed while she called her sister. Her sister was going to drive down. Her parents would come for the final rights.
JEFFERS,"A terrible night. No sooner than I shut my eyes desolation came upon me. What is one’s last thought as you pull the trigger? “There goes my head” or “Jesus watch over me?” Or neither? I’m going to tear these pages out. This journal brings me no peace. It’s self-pity, nothing more."
TOLLER,I awoke at three with a cry. It has been five months since I sensed the first warning signs.
JEFFERS,I went into the church and fell asleep on a bench.
TOLLER,How easily they talk about prayer those who have never really prayed.
JEFFERS,This sounds great. I’m going to have to sharpen my chops for the reconsecration. Do you know what they want to play?
TOLLER,"Not a clue. Abundant Life is handling the invites and seating. Basically I’m going to introduce Joel, he’ll give a little spiel, introduce the Governor, maybe Ed Balq."
JEFFERS,Why him?
TOLLER,"It’s sort of his deal, I guess. He’s underwriting everything. He paid for the organ. There’s another music thing I want to talk about."
TOLLER,"Actually, it’s a sad bit of business. The Michael Mensana memorial. The scattering of his ashes. He asked me to arrange it."
BALQ,He asked you?
JEFFERS,He left a letter. He had some requests.
BALQ,"Reverend Toller, can I help you?"
BALQ,"I’ve been meaning to come in. We’ve run out of First Reformed T-shirts. We have some small sizes, but not the others."
BALQ,...Since I made my commitment I have felt the Lord moving in my life. If happiness came in pill size it would have “JC” stamped on it. Continuous release size. I wake up feeling better. My relationships are better. I got a raise last week. I find myself in prayer without even thinking about it.
JEFFERS,"Thank you, Jason. That’s very inspiring. Praise Jesus. My every breath is a prayer. Thoughts, reactions?"
BALQ,"Yes, Cynthia?"
JEFFERS,"Three months ago my father got laid off. He can’t find any work. Nobody loves the Lord more than my father. He’s always testifying, he volunteers. Did he do something wrong?"
TOLLER,"Reverend Toller from First Reformed is siting in with us today. How do you answer that, Reverend?"
JEFFERS,"There are some church people, good Christians, who make a connection between godliness and wealth, but that’s not what Jesus teaches. That’s not what He lived. There was no dollar sign on His pulpit. There’s no American flag either. No, Cynthia, your father--"
JEFFERS,"Christians shouldn’t succeed, that what he means. Christianity is for losers."
TOLLER (V.O.),Jake.
JEFFERS,"I get tired of “turn the other cheek.” Jesus didn’t turn the other cheek. Why stand for anything? Take prayer out of the schools, give money to people too lazy to work-- and whatever you do, don’t offend the Muslims."
BALQ,"What is it? Honest, Joel. I bring up the poor and the next thing a teenager acts like you just shit on the American flag. Forgive my language."
JEFFERS,Roger told me.
BALQ,He’s a good man.
BALQ,He said you kept your cool. He admired you for doing that.
TOLLER,"Everything is so extreme. There’s no middle ground. Us versus them. We’re right, they’re wrong let’s go to war."
BALQ,"It’s the times. These are frightening times. These kids grow up in a world we can hardly imagine. A sea of pornography from the time they’re ten years old, hyper violent video games, a world without privacy, each kid isolated, communicating through media. A world without hope. Raised on a diet of terrorism, nuclear threats and global warming. You don’t know what it’s like to raise a kid in this--"
TOLLER,I did raise a kid.
BALQ,"I didn’t mean it that way. They’re frightened. They want certainty. Don’t think, follow. They fall prey to extremism. Jihadism is everywhere."
JEFFERS,Even here.
BALQ,That’s not the church that called me.
JEFFERS,"Nor me. Our mission is to be inclusive. We are a union of believers. That’s why we have the architecture we do. We must listen, guide, encourage young members to express themselves and not judge them. We must lead by example."
TOLLER,We must be patient.
BALQ,Then the Lord spoke to Job out of the storm. He said: “Who is this that obscures my plans with words without knowledge? Where were you when I laid the earth’s foundation? Who marked off its dimensions? Who laid its cornerstone while the morning stars sang together and all the angels shouted for joy?”...
TOLLER,These surroundings were chosen by Michael as the repository for his physical remains. I say physical because Michael’s spirt and memories live on with us. As does his mission. Michael cared about this world. Perhaps too much. Suffering does not hold. Is not the last word. Resurrection has sway. He’s gone but not his mission. It lives on within us. Mary will lead family and friends in the spreading of Michael’s ashes as the Abundant Life Youth a capella Choir sings a song chosen by Michael.
TOLLER,Sorry I’m late. Got held up.
BALQ,You know Reverend Toller.
TOLLER,Just by sight. Ed Balq. Good to meet you.
TOLLER (V.O.),Bring me a coffee. And the apple pie.
BALQ,The apple pie--I know it’s a cliche. Organic. They make it right here. Local.
TOLLER,I’ve got a surprise for you.
BALQ,I stopped at the printer on the way over.
TOLLER,They did a great job.
BALQ,All the guests at the reconsecration will get a copy. There’ll also be a mailing. And of course it will be available in the bookstore. How are the plans coming?
JEFFERS,The organ’s been repaired?
TOLLER,It sounds better than ever before.
BALQ,We’ve drawn up a seating chart.
TOLLER,"Mayor Wilson and the Governor will be there. Head of National Association of Evangelicals, representatives from NCC, the Office of the Chaplain. Then of course the people from the business community, the financial community..."
BALQ,"All those mighty men of God, servants of the cross. Years of service--baptisms, confessions, funerals, sermons. The hours in prayer, the afflictions suffered. Did God give them strength? Did He hear them?"
TOLLER,"...Reverend Toller will introduce me, I’ll introduce the Governor. There will be a song selection. The main choir will perform at Abundant Life--"
BALQ,There won’t be anything political will there?
TOLLER (V.O.),"No, why would there be?"
MARY,Do you mind?
TOLLER,I ask because this was brought to my attention.
MARY,It’s a print-out from a website.
TOLLER,Both First Reformed and Abundant Life are mentioned by name.
MARY,This was a political event. Neil Young?
TOLLER,I was respecting the wishes of the deceased and the widow. These were their instructions for the memorial service.
MARY,At a toxic waste site with the press in attendance?
TOLLER,The press was not notified. These are Mensana’s friends.
MARY,"It was a political act. You and the choir represented the Abundant Life Church. The Hanstown Kills site, by the way, is not even polluted. It was cleaned up with EPA superfunds."
TOLLER,Hanstown was not--?
TOLLER,"Of course not, but give me some credit. I’m in the energy business. It’s my business to stay informed."
MARY,Sorry. Reverend Toller didn’t understand the implications.
TOLLER,Mind if I ask a question?
MARY,Go ahead.
TOLLER,Will God forgive us?
MARY,Will God forgive us for what we are doing to his creation?
TOLLER,That was the question Michael Mensana asked me when I visited him.
MARY,There’s a lot of loose talk about environmental change.
TOLLER,There is a scientific consensus. Ninety-seven percent of the scientific community. The “other” side consists of lobbyists and paid deniers.
MARY,The man who says nothing always seems more intelligent. Why couldn’t I just keep silent?
MARY,It’s a complicated subject.
TOLLER,"What is the benefit? Cui bono? Setting aside the Biblical call to stewardship, who profits when we soil our own nest? What is to gain?"
MARY,Could we just agree to keep politics out of the reconsecration service?
MARY,What God wants--
TOLLER,"You know the mind of God? He spoke to you personally, told you His plans for earth?"
TOLLER (V.O.),"Look, I understand you’re upset. You found the body, correct?"
TOLLER (V.O.),How?
TOLLER (V.O.),We were supposed to meet. He texted me the location.
TOLLER,"And you counseled him, Reverend?"
ELDER,Yes.
ESTHER,You counseled him. Then he shot himself.
ELDER,Yes.
ESTHER,"I think you need to step back, Reverend. Look at your own life before you criticize others."
ELDER,Mary and I rode the rail line trail. I had not ridden a bicycle I think in twenty years. I was afraid I would fall. It is amazing the simple curative power of exercise. It’s God given.
ESTHER,Thank you again. Michael and I used to cycle twice a week. I missed it so much.
ELDER,It’s been a long time. I enjoyed it. But it was under protest.
DOCTOR,Because?
TOLLER,I asked my doctor.
DOCTOR,Just the same.
TOLLER,Can I ask another favor?
DOCTOR,What?
TOLLER,Would you box up Michael’s clothes? Or find someone to do it?
DOCTOR,Are you sure you want to give them away so quickly?
TOLLER,Not give it away. Just box them up. It just so difficult to be surrounded by all those smells. Memories.
DOCTOR,I can do it.
TOLLER,Have you decided?
DOCTOR,The rent is paid for two months so there’s no hurry. I’ll move in with my sister and brother-in-law until the baby is born.
TOLLER,You’ll relocate there?
DOCTOR,I don’t know. She’s already contacted an obstetrician.
TOLLER,A boy or a girl?
CAMERA ASSISTANT,My next visit I’ll find out.
JEFFERS,"Something I’ve been meaning to ask, if it isn’t too painful."
ESTHER,Do you think he would have really harmed someone?
ESTHER,"He’d been involved in non violent protests, we both had, he’d been put in jail. He could lose his temper, start yelling at the police. But no, I don’t think he was violent."
TOLLER,I just wonder if I should have done something differently.
ESTHER,He did not want to live.
TOLLER,"He was not a religious man, you know. He didn’t care for the church. That was me. I was the one who asked him to come. I was raised in the church and I’ve never been able to quite let it go. When I’m in a strange city I’ll just go in a church and sit down. I was the spiritual one."
ESTHER,Thanks.
TOLLER,I’ll get some boxes. Come back later to take care of the clothes.
ESTHER,"Before you go, would you pray with me?"
TOLLER,I find it difficult to do alone. The words don’t come. Are you uncomfortable with me asking that?
ESTHER,No. Of course not.
TOLLER,I spoke and the words came out of my mouth. “By thy words you shall be justified and by thy words you shall be condemned.”
ESTHER,I can no longer ignore my health. I have postponed my checkup too often. Yesterday I literally could barely stand.
TOLLER,No. I have not lost my faith.
ESTHER,"“...and he said I will pull down my barns, and build greater and I will say to my soul, take thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry. But God said unto him, Thou fool, this night thy soul shall be required of thee. So is he that layeth up treasure for himself, and is not rich toward God. And he said unto his disciples, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat; neither for the body, what ye shall put on. The life is more than meat, and the body is more than raiment.”"
TOLLER,He was out most of Friday.
ESTHER,He went to Albany? For his checkup?
TOLLER,I kind of asked him but he didn’t volunteer anything. You know how he is.
ESTHER,Perhaps I can check.
TOLLER,Esther.
TOLLER (V.O),It’s just that...
TOLLER (V.O.),I know.
TOUR GUIDE,We like to do a gastroscopic exam. We lower a fiber optic camera down the throat and esophagus and take a look around. It’s an outpatient procedure with local anesthetic. You should be able to leave by mid afternoon.
TOLLER (V.O.),That doesn’t sound good.
TOLLER (V.O.),We want to check for evidence of malignancy.
SECURITY OFFICER,Cancer.
TOLLER,It’s a possibility. Cancer is not the fearsome medical foe it once was.
SECURITY OFFICER,What is the treatment?
TOLLER,It depends on how advanced the tumor is. You stated that you have been experiencing discomfort?
SECURITY OFFICER,Six months?
TOLLER,"Diet, medication, chemo, even surgery. We have a variety of diagnostic tools. Have you had bloody stools?"
TOLLER (O.S.),Yes.
MARY (O.S.),How recently?
TOLLER (O.S.),I would like to schedule the gastroscopy as soon as possible. We have an open slot the week after next. What is your diet?
TOLLER,"I get hungry, I eat."
MARY,Do you smoke?
MARY,Drink?
MARY,In moderation.
TOLLER,That needs to end. I’m writing a prescription that will help with the stomach pain. I want you to take nutritional supplements. You should put on a little weight. Nutrihelp is a good over the counter supplement. Drink a bottle morning and night. Are you in pain now?
MARY,"No. Actually, I feel quite good."
TOLLER,"Joel Jeffers, Daily Devotion number 174, take 2."
MARY,"“Refrain from anger and turn from wrath; do not fret--it only leads to evil. Psalm 37:8. We tend to think that a little anxiety and worry are simply an indication of how wise we are yet it’s a much better indication of how wicked we are. Fretting arises from our determination to have our own way. Our Lord never worried and was never anxious, because His purpose was never to accomplish his own plans but to fulfill God’s plans...”"
TOLLER,I’ll be back in a bit.
MARY,Reverend.
TOLLER,"Hello, Esther."
MARY,I didn’t know you were coming.
TOLLER,Joel’s office wanted to go over the reconsecration program. Has he discussed it with you?
MARY,"I’ll be at First Reformed. Stanley will be with the full choir here. The acoustics will be wonderful. I mean, wonderful. Did you hear from Albany?"
TOLLER,Yeah.
MARY,What did they say?
MARY,Nothing much. More tests.
TOLLER,A gastroscopy.
MARY,And you know this how?
TOLLER,I’m worried about you.
MARY,Leave me alone.
TOLLER,I just want--
MARY,"I know what you want. I cannot bear your concern, you constant hovering. Your neediness. It’s a constant reminder of my failings and inadequacies. You want something that never was and never will be."
TOLLER,Don’t make me do this.
MARY,Don’t you see yourself?
TOLLER,You don’t take care of yourself.
MARY,I despise you. I despise what you bring out in me. Your concerns are petty. You are a stumbling block.
TOLLER,"I suddenly feel much better. I awoke early, clear-headed and immediately set about my daily tasks."
MARY,"“Behold, I show you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed.”"
SURIYA,"Balg Home Products, makers of paper goods, fertilizers, everyday items for the household, was among the first companies to realize the need to address environmental concerns. Balq is green..."
BENNY,Today I stopped. I had Miso and fish. When was the last time? Such simple pleasures. Why do we deny ourselves?
SURIYA,I’ve removed the previous pages. They were written in a delirium. But I am determined to continue. It’s hard to struggle against torpor. I must set pen to paper.
SURIYA,May I be of some assistance?
SURIYA,I...I think I must have the wrong address.
ROSA,This is a private community. Did you receive clearance at the security kiosk?
SURIYA,Kiosk? I didn’t see any kiosk.
TOLLER,"Would you please follow me, Reverend? I will escort you back to the highway."
TOLLER,Thank you.
TOLLER,Mary.
TOLLER,Can I come in?
TOLLER (V.O.),Of course.
NURSE,What’s going on? Are you all right?
TOLLER (V.O.),No.
TOLLER (V.O.),I’m frightened. I’m frightened of everything.
JEFFERS,I woke up. My heart was pounding. I thought the ceiling was going to fall in. I had to get out. I drove around.
JEFFERS,I didn’t put on any makeup.
TOLLER,"I’m glad you came. You need anything, water, tea?"
JEFFERS,"Without any reason. It’s like a dark curtain just...fell. Everything scares me. The news on TV, a conversation, the weather."
TOLLER,Have you seen your doctor?
JEFFERS,"He prescribed antidepressants. He said they were safe. Well, he said it was highly unlikely it would hurt Michael."
JEFFERS,Michael?
TOLLER,The baby. It’s a boy. I didn’t tell you?
JEFFERS,No.
TOLLER,But I don’t want to take anything which may affect the baby.
JEFFERS,You were right to come.
TOLLER,I can’t stop my thoughts. They just go on and on and repeat and repeat.
JEFFERS,Did you have these fears before Michael’s death?
JEFFERS,A little. But not like this. Michael seemed so strong.
TOLLER,I read online that they used to believe pregnancy made you happy but now they feel it just makes your feelings more extreme.
JEFFERS,How did Michael help you?
TOLLER,You mean before?
TOLLER,Before he became absent.
JEFFERS,"He listened. He was kind. We did something we called the Magical Mystery Tour. It sounds silly. We’d share a joint then we would lie on top of each other fully clothed. Try to get as much body to body contact as possible. He also called it the 80% Solution. Hands out, look each right into the eyes. Then move our eyes in unison, right, left, right, left. And breathe in rhythm."
TOLLER,And you want me to do this?
JEFFERS,"No, I didn’t mean it that way."
TOLLER,Well. Yes. I guess I did.
JEFFERS,Okay. Show me.
TOLLER,But without the marihuana.
JEFFERS,The baby?
JEFFERS,How do we do this?
TOLLER,Lie on your back with your arms and legs stretched out.
JEFFERS,You need music?
TOLLER,"No, just listen to the breaths."
JEFFERS,"Benny, stop that."
MARY,He started it.
TOLLER,Quiet. Listen.
MARY,"This week we read “The Patchwork Path,” about the Underground Railroad which was not a railroad but--what was it?"
TOLLER,Rosa?
TOLLER,It was a slave trail.
MARY,"It was an escape route from the South to the North and this church, First Reformed, was part of the route. Reverend Toller."
TOLLER,"Slaves fleeing north to Canada were helped, fed and hidden at churches and homes along the route. Calvin Verlander, the dominee, minister, of First Reformed was active in the Abolitionist movement. He arranged...follow me. Look at this. Miss Suriya, could you give me a hand?"
MARY,Who can help me? Benny?
TOLLER,"Look, what do you see?"
MARY,Do you see a metal hook? There.
TOLLER,What would happen if we pulled it? Can you grab it?
MARY,"Slaves would hide here. Sometimes whole families. Can you imagine that? In the darkness. The air hot, shaking with fear. Hearing the horses of the slave hunters outside? On their knees, holding each other’s hands, praying to God to save them?"
TOLLER,"The stomach pains have returned. Yesterday I groveled on the floor, moaning like a sick beast. Will God’s grace ever shine on me?"
MARY,Reverend Toller?
TOLLER,"If one is awake, can he become more awake?"
MARY,Every act of preservation is an act of creation. Everything preserved renews creation. It’s how we participate in creation.
TOLLER,Close the door. Take a seat.
MARY,We’re concerned about you.
TOLLER (V.O.),Who is?
LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT,How’s your health?
STATEMENT OF PURPOSE,I need some more tests.
JEFFERS,You didn’t get the results?
ELDER,"How’s your diet? To be honest, you don’t look so good."
JEFFERS,I’ve been having some stomach trouble.
JEFFERS,I hear you’ve been drinking.
TOLLER (V.O.),Just a little wine with dinner.
ESTHER,Wine? That’s not advisable for a man with stomach problems.
MARY,I’ve got to take better care of myself.
ESTHER (O.S.),You’re always in the Garden.
,"Jesus wasn’t always in the Garden, on his knees, sweating drops of blood. No, he was on the Mount, in the temple, in the marketplace. But you’re always in the Garden. For you every hour is the Darkest Hour. Don’t confuse Post Traumatic Stress with the Holy Agony."
